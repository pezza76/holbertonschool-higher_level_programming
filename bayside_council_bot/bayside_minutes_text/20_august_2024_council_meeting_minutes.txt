6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question related to questions from political candidates at
Council meetings and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
Part 1 Why is Bayside City Council allowing a federal political candidate to waste our precious
15 minutes of local council public question time on federal political issues?
Part 2 What are councils governance rules on public question time regarding questions that
pertain to federal political candidate agenda's which are well outside of our local council
issues?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 In accordance with Division 8, section 57 of the Council’s Governance Rules, public
question time is provided at every Council meeting to provide all members of the public
the opportunity to submit questions to Council.
Part 2 The Rules make provision for the CEO or Mayor to determine if matters are disallowed,
including any matters that fall outside the duties, functions or powers of a Council.
Where this occurs, the submitter would be advised accordingly.
2. Ms Kristina Kaulenas submitted a question related to street trees and Ms Kaulenas
asked:
Question
I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed removal of three historic and
significant Oak trees on Union Street, which are slated to be removed for the development of
the Oak Grange Retirement Village.
I am concerned about the impact on the local environment and heritage. Could you please
provide clarity on the following:
Part 1 What considerations are being given to the preservation of these additional Oak
trees in light of their historical and community significance?
Part 2 What steps are being taken to explore alternative solutions that would allow for the
preservation of these trees while still facilitating the development?
Response from the CEO
The applicant has lodged an application to amend the Victorian Civil and Administrative
Tribunal issued planning permit. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal will determine
the application. To date Council has not formed an opinion on the proposal, though a report
will be presented to the Planning and Amenity Delegate Committee to confirm Council's
position on the proposal prior to the merit hearing.
The assessment of all changes will be assessed and considering against the provisions of the
Bayside Planning Scheme, which includes environmental considerations.

3. Mr Andrew Hockley submitted a question related to the Thriving Suburbs Grants
Program and Mr Hockley asked:
Question
I draw Council’s attention to the Thriving Suburbs Grants Program, a Commonwealth
Government funding round which closes on 26th August 2024 and is designed to provide
matched funding of between $500,000 and $15 million for urban and suburban community
infrastructure.
Part 1 Has the City of Bayside applied for any funding under the Thriving Suburbs
Program?
Part 2 If so, which projects did Council seek funding for? If not, why not?
Response from the CEO
Council is currently preparing an application to the Thriving Suburbs Grant Program for its
warm water pool project. This application will be submitted prior to the application closing date.
4. Mr Geoff Leigh submitted a question related to Cr Lawrence Evans in respect of
each annual budget and Mr Leigh asked:
Question
During each of the years that Councillor Lawrence Evans has served on Bayside Council
list below. In respect of each annual council budget passed by councillors list
Part 1 Each time and year Cr Evans has voted for the budget
Part 2 Each time and year Cr Evans has voted against the budget
Response from the CEO
Cr Evans voted ‘for’ adoption of the budget on each occasion from (and including) the 2015–
16 budget through to (and including) the 2024–25 budget. At the time of consideration of the
2013–14 and 2014–15 budgets, the Minutes did not record the distribution of votes (known as
a ‘division’) and no recording or transcript is available.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
5. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to the validity of its
Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021. The question will not be read out in
accordance with Division 8 of Council’s Governance Rules – and specifically Section
57, subsection (9)(c), which states that “a question may be disallowed by the Chief
Executive Officer (or, at the Meeting, by the Chair) if the Chief Executive Officer or
Chair determines that it deals with a subject matter already publicly answered, or is a
repetitious or vexatious question from the same questioner”. I will however ask for a
comment from the CEO.
Comment from the CEO
Council has received similar questions from Mr George Reynolds regarding the validity and
enforceability of Council’s Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021 (the Local
Law). Responses have been provided at the 19 December 2023, 20 February 2024 and 19
March 2024 Council Meetings.
Council maintains the Local Law is valid and legally enforceable.
6. Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question related to rates and charges for
2024–25 and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
Part 1 The total amount raised in rates and charges is $117,192,000 yet the estimated
cost off the works to be paid for by such charges is only $80,410,593, is the
additional 45% capital loading a Special Rate which has been raised without notice.
Part 2 Will Council have the rate charge audited for correctness before we are required to
pay.
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council does not levy any special rates or charges. The total amount raised in rates
and charges of $117,192,000 for 2024/25 will fund services provided to the community
of $76,015 million with the balance of $41.177 million funding the capital program of
$55.7 million.
Part 2: The Essential Services Commission audits every council annually to ensure
compliance with the rate cap. The latest council compliance report found that all
councils complied with the average rate cap. This report is located on their website.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
7. Mr Geoff Leigh submitted a further question related to Wangara Road and Mr Leigh
asked:
Question
Part 1 Given the known evidence that the former tip site was seriously contaminated, what
evidence was provided to council the site was safe to be used for children’s sporting
facilities.
Part 2 Why was it left to resident complaints to the Environment Protection Authority to
step in and ban its use for sporting facilities as clearly councillors and officers
weren’t aware of the site’s serious contamination.
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council has undertaken several site assessments and environmental reports in relation
to the Wangara Road site which have outlined the measures required to be undertaken
in order to increase public activation at the site. Council’s due diligence during the
planning stages identified the extent of existing contamination and the scope of the
associated rehabilitation plan, as guided by the Environment Protection Authority. The
monitoring undertaken by Council and the design of the cap are the critical elements
to ensure the site is safe for its intended use.
Part 2 This is not a correct representation of the events that led to the proposal to shift the
netball centre from Wangara Road to Holloway Road. The Wangara Road site was
known to be contaminated given its historic use as a landfill, which was conveyed in
the report presented to Council in August 2017 regarding the potential sites and their
initial opportunities and constraints.
8. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question related to costs associated with the Dendy
Beach Pavilion Project and Mr Howard asked:
Question
Part 1 What were Council's total legal costs associated with the Dendy Beach Life Saving
Pavilion project, including the hearings at VCAT, Supreme Court of Victoria and the
Court of Appeal?
Part 2 Is it possible that Council could have avoided going to court against its own
residents and ratepayers, and delivered the new Life Saving Pavilion years earlier
by compromising on the design of the new building? (yes or no)
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The total costs associated with the engagement of consultants/experts and legal
representation associated with all the various proceedings (inclusive of VCAT, the
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal) is in the order of $991,000.
Part 2 It should be noted that a small group of residents took legal action against Council and
that Council quite rightly defended its position and won.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
9. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a further question related to cash reserves and Mr
Howard asked:
Question
Part 1 What is the total of Council's cash reserves at present?
Part 2 What is the current balance of the Open Space Reserve (funds collected
through the Open Space levy) in Council's accounts?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council’s cash and investments total $123.2 million. The bulk of these funds are
committed to delivering the capital projects programmed over the next 4 years.
Part 2 There is currently $35.1 million in the Open Space Reserve.
10. Ms Sara Davis submitted a question related to road safety in school zones and Ms
Davis asked:
Question
Part 1 If Council is making vital decisions on behalf of vulnerable children, on crash data
that is not accurate, how will Council correct its error and obtain accurate crash
data to inform the decision regarding the ‘Balcombe Road no stopping’ initiative.
Part 2 The majority of residents want safer cycling in the area as indicated by the majority
voting in favour of the ‘Balcombe Rd no stopping initiative’. If Council is not going
ahead, what is the alternative safety plan to ensure children can safely ride to and
from school.
What is Council’s plan?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The data used is collated by the Victorian Department of Transport and Planning, and
is used throughout the State to provide a casualty crash history on our roads. The data
includes casualty crashes only, which are those that involve an injury to a person.
Crashes which do not result in an injury are not captured, and as a key objective is
safety in this case, using casualty crash data is reasonable.
Part 2 The responses evaluated included not only the raw votes collected, but also the
feedback provided with the votes, and this was considered in totality. There is a marked
wide kerbside lane currently available on Balcombe Road for those who wish to ride,
alternatively children under the age of 13 can legally ride on the footpath, or there are
routes through local streets which experience less vehicle traffic.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
11. Ms Alysia Regan submitted a question related to road safety and Ms Regan asked:
Question
Road safety for all users is apparently a key priority for Council and Council has shared
with the public that it will continue to promote this through various projects and advocacy
with the Department of Transport and Planning which manages the arterial road network.
What are these projects?
Response from the CEO
Improved road safety is implemented through various transport and traffic works programs
which include improved pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, traffic and parking control signs,
improvement to sight lines, traffic calming works, reducing vehicle speeds and improvements
to assist vulnerable road users on our network.
Key road safety advocacy items with the Department of Transport and Planning include priority
pedestrian crossings on Bluff Road, Beach Road, the Esplanade, and Bay Road, and speed
limit reductions on arterial roads.
12. Ms Alysia Regan submitted a further question related to revitalisation of Peterson
Reserve and Ms Regan asked:
Question
Our community 56 year old football club, which is made up of Bayside residents has for 2
years in a row been left without allocation of a home ground and pavilion.
Local government faces increasing, demanding and complex community expectations.
With limited resources and competing demands.
Part 1 Is there strategic collaboration and partnerships between councils that can
respond to these challenges?
Part 2 With no budget from Bayside Council set aside for the revitalisation of the
facilities at Peterson Reserve, doesn’t it make sense to include another club to
financially support this council asset?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council officers engage and collaborate with neighbouring Councils to consider
sports ground allocation opportunities. With the demand for sportsgrounds high,
Council’s Sports Facility User Guide outlines how Council will prioritise user group
allocations.
Part 2 Council has foreshadowed approximately $7.4 million between 2025 and 2028 to
facilitate the redevelopment of the three sports pavilions at Peterson Reserve.
Page No. 12

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
13. Ms Megan Fallon submitted a question related to community consultation for the
Balcombe Road bicycle lane and Ms Fallon asked:
Question
On the recent community consultation about no stopping in the bicycle lane on Balcombe
Road for set hours, council only revealed that submissions from objectors who lived on or
streets off Balcombe Road would have more weighting than other submissions. Why did
Council not state this would be the case on their website during the community consultation
period so the community could make an informed decision?
Response from the CEO
In evaluating the responses received, there was consideration given not only to the raw votes
in favour and opposed, but also the feedback provided around how the project would impact
the respondent. While there was a small majority in favour of proceeding, there was strong
opposition from a directly affected subset of respondents who provided detailed argument for
their position.
14. Mr Douglas Klein on behalf of Highett Progress Association also submitted a
question before the closure of receipt for public questions; however, the question was
omitted erroneously. The question and the response since provided to Mr Klein is as
follows:
Question
Noting tonight’s Integrated Transport Strategy update includes many traffic issues on which
Council is actively lobbying the Government:
Part 1: Why is council not seeking a DTP review and funding for a two lane intersection
at Graham and Bay Roads, given that Graham Road will suffer the greatest traffic
increase of any Collector road in Bayside with the addition of thousands of new
residents in the next few years?
Part 2: Given the studies and funding allocated to Holloway Rd, why does Council deem
reducing local traffic pressure in Sandringham more crucial than managing the
surge resulting from Highett Common, Bayside’s largest residential development
where traffic pressure will be daily and not simply event based?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The intersection of Bay Road and Graham Road is the responsibility of the
Department of Transport and Planning (DTP). As part of the Development Plan
approval for the redevelopment of the former CSIRO property at 37 Graham
Road, Highett, the DTP placed a requirement on the developer to upgrade at the
Bay Road/Graham Road intersection to that of a signalised intersection to its
satisfaction.
The developer of the property has complied with the planning requirement
imposed by DTP and has submitted plans which have been deemed acceptable
to the relevant Road Authority, being DTP. Council has supported the proposed
upgrade with the allocation of funding toward the project. While the Functional
Layout Plan has been approved by DTP, it is understood that the detailed
design is currently being finalised.
Whilst DTP approved the scope of the works as part of the Development Plan
approval, it is not possible to place additional obligations on the developer to
Page No. 13

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 August 2024
redesign the intersection and acquire land after the approval has been scoped,
costed and granted. Any change in the scope to increase the capacity of the
intersection would be the responsibility of DTP to design and fund.
Part 2 As part of the statutory planning process for the development at 37 Graham
Road, Highett, there have been studies undertaken in the Highett area.
Notwithstanding the previous work, due to the changing landscape as a result of
the Suburban Rail Loop Project and discussion with local stakeholders, a
further 'current traffic conditions study' is being arranged for the Highett area.
The survey work is anticipated to commence at the start of the Victorian School
term 4, and the results anticipated by the end of the calendar year.
