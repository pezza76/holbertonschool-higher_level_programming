6. Public Question Time
1. Ms Alison Joseph submitted a question related to the Dendy beach Pavilion
project, and Ms Joseph asked:
Question
Part 1 What was the total cost of the Dendy Beach Pavilion project (ie all project
related costs including planning, design, soil contamination assessment and
works, earthworks and soil disposal, road works, concrete forecourt, building
planning and works, storm water planning and construction, carpark, leasing
costs , total legal cost, consultant costs, project management cost and internal
staff costs etc)?
Part 2 What rent does the Council receive for this outlay?
Response from the CEO
Part 1: The total project expenditure on the Dendy Beach Pavilion to date from its
conception in 2014–15, is $24.9 million. This includes the storm water
drainage improvements and realignment of the Bay Trail.
Part 2: There are two tenants on the site. The Brighton Life Saving Club pays a
community rental of $3,294 + GST per annum, escalating at a fixed 3%
percent per annum.
The Dendy Beach Pavilion Café pays a market rent of $80,000 + GST per
annum, escalating at a fixed 5% per annum. The café is also subject to an
annual turnover rental.
2. Mr Stephen Tonini submitted a question related to the bus parking zone at
the Brighton Savoy Hotel and Mr Tonini asked:
Question
Can I please ask council to re-consider the "Bus Parking Zone” installed in October
2024 opposite the Brighton Savoy Hotel on the Esplanade?
Response from the CEO
Council is currently collecting data in traffic and parking movements in the vicinity of
Dendy Beach Pavilion and will use this data to refine parking controls.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 March 2025
3. Mr Ben Lonsdale submitted a question related to the bike facility at the corner
of Tulip Street and Reserve Road, and Mr Lonsdale asked:
Question
The Wangara Reserve Masterplan was adopted in July 2024, with a recommendation
to upgrade the Tulip St bike reserve. Can council please advise the scope of these
works and a timeline for completion? The current Tulip St facility is outdated and
unsafe for most users, and there is an obvious desire within the community for a
modern offroad cycling facility in Bayside.
Response from the CEO
The upgrade to the Reserve Road pump track has not currently been scoped and
has not had a schedule developed. The Council resolution in July 2024 referred the
matter of minor upgrades to the dirt track to Council’s 2025–26 budget process which
is currently under consideration.
4. Mr Ian Cochrane submitted a question related to the Bay Road/Station Street
roundabout in Sandringham, and Mr Cochrane asked:
Question
The condition of the Bay Road/Station Street roundabout in Sandringham Village has
been raised many times since 2003 in both writing and discussion by individual
ratepayers and at least 2-community groups. This village entry point was also raised
at a STA info meeting 12-months ago.
Can Bayside Council please play its part to find a solution and finish the job
regardless of the often-stated problems?
Response from the CEO
The Bay Road/Station Road roundabout is a Department of Transport and Planning
asset and as such Council has no control over the maintenance and appearance of
it. Council officers are exploring options with the Department of Transport and
Planning regarding appropriate aesthetic improvements, that are not to the detriment
to the operation of the roundabout.
5. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a question related to the Bayside Warm
Water Pool facility, and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
What is the percentage of the proposed Warm Water Pool footprint which will be
occupied by Bluefit's Golf Pro Shop?
Response from the CEO
The floor area of the overall warm water pool facility is approximately 1750 square
metres, with the Pro-shop comprising approximately 128 square metres, or 7.3%.
Page No. 8

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 March 2025
6. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a further question related to payment for the
Warm Water Pool’s architect, and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
Some time ago at a BCC meeting Council voted to approve to increase the payment
for the Warm Water Pool's architect above the then existing threshold of $1million.
What has the architect actually been paid?
Response from the CEO
A contract has been executed with the architectural firm to the value of $1,113,980.
To date, Council has approved payments to the design team to the value of
$547,570.
7. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Council’s provision for
GST, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
We ask a question on Council's provision for GST.
Part 1 As GST must be charged on services provided by the Municipal
Corporation (ACN 163566638), where in Council's budget and accounts is
this provision accounted for
Part 2 Has the Audit and Risk Committee been advised that this important matter
has not been reported?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council charges GST on all applicable goods and services.
As required in AASB Interpretation 1031 Accounting for the Goods and
Services Tax (GST) (AASB Interpretation 1031), revenue and expenses
are recognised net of the GST amount in the budget.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to the Australian
Taxation Office (ATO), is included as part of a receivable or payable in the
balance sheet. Receivables and payables are disclosed inclusive of GST.
Part 2 There is no requirement to advise the Audit and Risk Committee as
Council is complying with all its GST reporting requirements.
Page No. 9

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 March 2025
8. Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question related to fees and fines,
and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
We ask a question on fees and fines collected by Council.
Part 1 As fees and fines are collected for breaches of Local Laws, etc., is it
appropriate to account for them to be accounted for as revenue received
by Own-source Revenue, an activity which must follow Corporations Law
Part 2 Has the Audit and Risk Committee been advised of this questionable
matter?
Response from the CEO
Fees and fines collected by Council for breaches of Local Laws are recorded on
Council’s comprehensive income statement under ‘fees and charges’ which is
compliant with applicable accounting standards. The Audit and Risk Committee does
not need to be advised because there is no question about this treatment as it is
fairly straight forward.
