6. Public Question Time
1. Ms Michelle Bentley
Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a question related to Council’s Warm Water Pool project, and
Ms Bentley asked:
Question
A "hydrotherapy" pool is classified by the Victorian Department of Health and the
Physiotherapy Association as one where the water temperature is at least 34° and the ambient
temperature is complimentary to this. The Department of Health also stated that local
governments determine the "hydrotherapy" classification.
Why does Bayside City Council not wish to refer to at least the smaller of the two pools as a
"hydrotherapy" pool?
Response from the CEO
Warm water program pools are built to different standards to that of a health sector
hydrotherapy facility and provide greater flexibility to provide other intergenerational
programs.
Studies clearly indicate that the health sector hydrotherapy model is a restrictive facility
model and that a community accessed warm water program pool will attract higher usage
and be more operationally viable. The warm water pool will still deliver hydrotherapy services
and both spaces have been designed to incorporate both functions.
2. Mrs Jenat Kitchen
Mrs Jenat Kitchen submitted a question related to Council’s Warm Water Pool project, and Mrs
Kitchen asked:
Question
The concern regarding lack of public transport to the warm water pool hasn’t been addressed
could you please address & advise
Response from the CEO
The Traffic Impact Assessment Report published on Council’s website outlines the available
public transport methods proximate to the site, noting that the available options are limited.
Council will advocate to the Department of Transport to improve bus access to the site.

3. Mrs Anne Tregear
Mrs Anne Tregear submitted a question related to Council’s Warm Water Pool project, and
Mrs Tregear asked:
Question
In relation to the proposed warm pool: with the dropping of the moveable floor, which could
reduce the use of the pool, what will be the final depth and will it vary along the length?
Response from the CEO
The issue of pool depth will be confirmed through the detailed design process.
4. Mrs Anne Tregear
Mrs Anne Tregear submitted a question related to facilities at the Brighton Golf Course site,
and Mrs Tregear asked:
Question
In relation to the revised Proshop and new cafe, where will the kitchen and serving area be
positioned? Does this now mean that it will have full time staff employed instead of from
reception?
Response from the CEO
The detailed design of how the café will function will be resolved as part of the next stage of
the process, being the schematic design. How this facility will be staffed will be a decision for
the operator of the facility.

5. Ms Sue Ward
Mrs Sue Ward submitted a question related to Beaumaris Concourse and Black Rock Village
area, and Mrs Ward asked:
Question
Congratulations on your new peacemaking initiatives for Beaumaris Concourse and Black
Rock Village area. If the intention is to draw more people to the area is Council considering
upgrading/ modernising existing infrastructure that are basics needs for higher volumes of
people, in particular public toilet facilities?
In addition, can Council pay more attention to keeping existing facilities clean?
Response from the CEO
Public Toilets
Council is in the early stages of planning for a new Public Toilet Strategy which shall include
a program of capital works for public toilets and be open for community engagement prior to
adoption. Community engagement is planned to commence in February 2024 and interested
community members are encouraged to register with Bayside’s ‘Have Your Say’ page for
updates. The public toilets in the activity centres are cleaned every day throughout the year,
as well as on a reactive basis.
Footpath cleaning
Specific to the Beaumaris Concourse, a deeper clean for the Concourse footpath has been
recently completed, producing an excellent result. This was also carried out in Black Rock
Village and both activity centre traders have provided positive feedback on the deep cleaning
results.
6. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to the Council Plan activities in respect of
the Council Budget, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
In relation to the proposal to remove 18 planned activities from the 2023-2024 plan, due to a
capital budget overrun:
(a) Why does Council not use additional borrowing, as a permitted form of capital adjustment,
allowed, as shown in section 8(2)(b) of the Local Government (Planning and Reporting)
Regulations 2020, or
(b) Why not simply raise contributions by a Special Rate levy raised from the users, in
accordance with section 8(3)(b)(ii) of the Regulations?
Response from the CEO
Council is not proposing to remove 18 planned activities from the 2023–24 capital program.
These projects are carried forward due to construction delays or re-scheduling and will be
completed in future years.
Council has no current plans to use new borrowings or Special Rate levy to fund capital carry
forward items.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 November 2023
7. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to the Quarter 1 Performance Report, and
Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
in relation to the Quarter1 Performance Report, July to September 2023:
(a) Where in the income Statement, has Council shown the Income and expenditure statement
for Own source Revenue, and
(b) How much Council Cash was earned during the quarter (also shown as the " adjusted
underlying position" ) as shown in Schedule 3, Part 3 of the Local Government (Planning and
Reporting) Regulations, 2020 ?
Response from the CEO
(a) Own Source Revenue is total Council revenue less grants and contributions from
external parties. This is not required to be separately disclosed in Council’s Income
Statement.
Own source revenue for the September quarter was: $36.4M.
(b) Adjusted underlying surplus means adjusted underlying revenue less total
expenditure.
Adjusted underlying surplus for the September quarter is 2023–24 was $3.86M.
This is a different calculation to the cash earned during the quarter. Council’s budget
is predicting a decrease in the overall cash position for the year.
8. Mrs Victoria Smith
Mrs Victoria Smith submitted a question related to Brighton Playroom Occasional Care, and
Ms Smith asked:
Question
On Friday we were told that Brighton Playroom Occasional Care is going to close at the end
of 2023. There are no other occasional care or part-day childcare options in the area. Why is
it closing??
What can you do to help???? We do not want this centre to close.
Response from the CEO
Council was made aware last week by the Brighton Playroom Committee of Management
that the Brighton Playroom would be closing. We acknowledge that this service closing is
challenging and disappointing for the families who currently access this service.
The Committee of Management is independent from Council and is responsible for making
business decisions related to the running of the service.
Council will assess the options for the use of the space in the coming weeks.
