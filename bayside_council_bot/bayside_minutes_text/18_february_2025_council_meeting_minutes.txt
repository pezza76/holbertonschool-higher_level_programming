Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 February 2025
6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Ian Cochrane (on behalf of Sandringham Traders Association) submitted a
question related to train replacement buses, and Mr Cochrane asked:
Question
Although Traders are not new to buses replacing trains, we have not seen parked buses to
the extent experienced December 6-17 causing a massive depletion of parking for pre-
Christmas trading.
Part 1 Can these events be scheduled for other than directly before Christmas?
Part 2 We also ask if any non-urgent works, could be actioned other than during
business hours?
Response from the CEO
Rail replacement bus works are carried out by Metro Trains to support their works program
on the heavy rail network. Council has already met with Metro Trains representatives to
advocate for work to be phased to reduce the impact to local traders, particularly during peak
trade periods such as Christmas.
2. Ms Kylie Rowe submitted a question related to public tree maintenance, and Ms
Rowe asked:
Question
Could Council please clarify who is responsible for a nature strip tree, which the Council has
assessed as fine, that later falls and causes damage to private property?
Response from the CEO
Bayside City Council is committed to providing a safe environment for all people to enjoy.
Council delivers on this commitment through regular inspection of all trees, roads, footpaths,
open spaces, drains and infrastructure.
Council manages over 70,000 street and park trees in the public realm. All public trees are
subject to a 24-month inspection program with higher risk trees inspected more frequently.
Any member of the public may request an inspection of a public tree and Council arborists
may undertake an out of schedule inspection to understand the health of the tree and any
potential change to the risk the tree poses.
Council has a standardised process for anyone requesting compensation for any injury, loss
or damage due to negligence by Bayside City Council. Information for both requesting a tree
inspection and requesting compensation are available on Council’s website.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 February 2025
3. Ms Marika Okkas submitted a question related to Planning Scheme Amendment
C192 Bays, and Ms Okkas asked:
Question
The expert panel appointed by the Victorian government Planning minister, recommended
nearly 12 months ago that the Interim Heritage Covenant over my title be removed. When is
this going to happen please?
Response from the CEO
Planning Scheme Amendment C192bays implementing the Post War Modern Heritage Study
was submitted to the Minister for Planning for approval on 5 August 2024. Approval was
sought at this time to extend the interim heritage overlay on the properties that remained in
the amendment post the panel hearing, with the removal of those places that Council
adopted to remove. The Minister for Planning elected to keep interim controls on all
properties that were exhibited in the amendment until such time as final decision had been
made on C192bays. Timing on the approval of the amendment, and the removal of interim
controls is at the discretion of the Minister for Planning and outside of Council control.
4. Mr James Campbell submitted a question related to Planning Scheme Amendment
C192bays, and Mr Campbell asked:
Question
Bayside's Planning Scheme contains multiple interim heritage overlays. Two groups of
properties have controls that are due to expire in April and October this year, including all the
properties covered by C192bays.
I understand from a dated informal inquiry that the required submissions to amend Bayside's
Planning Scheme sit with the Minister for Transport and Planning and that she is in receipt of
the report provided by Planning Panels Victoria in relation to C192bays.
1. Is this understanding correct?
2. Have the responsible Council officers pursued this matter with their Departmental
counterpart to establish whether the Minister has all that she requires to make a
decision on all outstanding overlays without further delay?
Response from the CEO
Planning Scheme Amendment C192bays implementing the Post War Modern Heritage Study
was submitted to the Minister for Planning for approval on 5 August 2024. Approval was
sought at this time to extend the interim heritage overlay on the properties that remained in
the amendment post the panel hearing, with the removal of those places that Council opted
to remove. The Minister for Planning elected to keep the interim overlay on all properties that
were exhibited in the amendment until such time as final decision had been made on
C192bays.
The amendment was submitted to the Minster with copies of all submissions and the panel
report. Council officers continue to be in regular contact with the Department of Transport
and Planning regarding the amendment. The department has advised it does not require any
further information to process the amendment.

5. Mr Graham Roberts submitted a question related to bus parking zones, and Mr
Roberts asked:
Question
Can I please ask council to re-consider the Bus Parking Zone installed in October 2024
opposite the Brighton Savoy Hotel on the Esplanade?
Response from the CEO
Council is currently collecting data in traffic and parking movements in the vicinity of Dendy
Beach Pavilion and will use this data to refine parking controls.
6. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a question related to cost of Warm Water Pool
project, and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
How much money has Bayside City Council already spent, plus committed to spend, on the
Warm Water Pool Project, including initial community surveys, research into finding a site,
community consultations, Council officers' time including Bluefit negotiations, cultural
explorations, expert physiotherapy consultations, design and architect fees and anything else
which is relevant to the project?
Response from the CEO
Warm Water Pool expenditure since 2021–22 to date includes:
$1.33M expenditure (feasibility, salaries, consulting and design)
A further $0.785M committed to the project.
Total: $2.12 million.
7. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a further question related to the Warm Water Pool
project, and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
Community members have heard that the completion of the Warm Water Pool project might
not have the support of the new council.
Does this Council support this project?
Response from the CEO
Council will be considering its 4-year budget over the next few months which will include a
review of the capital works program. The proposed budget will be released for public
comment in April/May 2025.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 February 2025
8. Mr Robert Hay submitted a question related to active transport infrastructure, and Mr
Hay asked:
Question
The Bayside area is falling well behind many other inner-city councils in active transport
infrastructure.
Part 1 When will Bayside council get serious about active transport infrastructure and what
active transport initiatives are currently funded within the budget.
Part 2 When will we see a genuine commitment away from car dependency and support for
people who choose not to drive everywhere?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 There are a number of active transport initiatives in the current financial year budget,
including pedestrian priority crossing treatments being developed at 2 roundabouts
on New Street, a shared space treatment on Allard Street, a new footpath connection
under a rail bridge on Durrant Street, and development and delivery of improvements
on the Bay Trail. Council’s Transport team has also been successful in securing
around $100k grant funding from the State government to support delivery of the New
Street projects.
Part 2 The above projects demonstrate Council’s support for those who choose not to drive.
Recent projects have delivered improvements to on-road cycling on Asling Street, a
cycling connection from Sandringham Station to Royal Avenue, pedestrian priority
crossings on George Street, improved connection from the footpath to the bus stop
on New Street, bench seating at bus stops, and bicycle parking infrastructure in
activity centres.
9. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to rates and charges, and Mr
Reynolds asked:
Question
We ask a question about the use of the rates and charges surplus to provide a capital
reserve which is used for the exclusive benefit of the Corporate Entity ACN 163 566 621.
Part 1 As the surplus of $36.781million is collected from non-voluntary contributions,
held in trust funds and may be shown to be an unlawful transfer to the
Corporate Entity, the Corporation will be $36.78 million short of funds to carry
out its capital works programme
Part 2 Is the Corporation now faced with the need to raise at least $36.78 million by
borrowing to maintain its works programme?
Response from the CEO
Part 1: Rates and charges have been raised in accordance with the Local
Government Act 2020 and the Local Government (Planning and Reporting)
Regulations 2020.
The total amount of rates and charges revenue forecast in 2024–25 of
$117.377 million will fund services provided to the community of $77.1 million
with the surplus balance of $40.3M funding the capital program.
Part 2: Council has no current requirement to borrow funds to maintain its capital
works program.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 February 2025
10. Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question related to the use of fees and
fines, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
We ask a question on use of fees and fines which are collected from breaches of State Law
and Local Law.
Part 1 As a budget item of $9.74 million has been credited to Own-source Revenue
from Fees and fines. and the Corporate Entity has to operate under
Corporations Law, it cannot use the authority given to Council (the non-
corporate entity), are the fees and fines going to be refunded as the staff had
no authority to act
Part 2 Is the Corporate Entity also faced with refunding to the non-corporate entity
other revenue claimed such as interest payments, some user fees, and some
rental fees?
Response from the CEO
Part 1: Council’s statutory fees and fines budget of $9.47M predominately includes
fees for parking, building and planning enforceable through state or local laws.
As previously advised, all fines and fees are valid and enforceable, including
authorised officers’ ability to issue infringements.
Part 2: Council has no requirement to refund other revenue including interest, user
fees and rental fees.
11. Mr Jeremy Abbott submitted a question related to the Reconciliation Action Plan
Advisory Committee, and Mr Abbott asked:
Question
How many First Nations community members has each council member had a discussion
with before making a decision on the Reconciliation Action Plan Advisory Committee?
Response from the CEO
I have no knowledge of what conversations, if any, have been held with Committee
members.

12. Mrs Karen Fitzgerald submitted a question related to fines issued to dog owners at
Ricketts Point, and Mrs Fitzgerald asked:
Question
Can Council please provide the number of fines issued to dog owners at Ricketts Point in
each of the financial years 2022–23 and 2023–24?
Response from the CEO
For financial year 2022–23, Council issued 10 warnings and 2 fines for dog offences at
Ricketts Point. In 2023–24, Council issued 4 warnings and 0 fines.
13. Mr Simon Ward submitted a question related to bus parking restrictions on Brighton
Beach esplanade, and Mr Ward asked:
Question
In relation to the new bus only parking area at Brighton Beach esplanade (opposite Brighton
Savoy and 166 Esplanade) would council advise the usage of this large area for bus parking
since implementing the new parking restrictions, how many buses and times of day is it being
used?
Response from the CEO
Council is currently collecting data on traffic and parking movements in the vicinity of Dendy
Beach Pavilion and will use this data to refine parking controls.
14. Ms Carolyn Amott submitted a question related to bus zone on Brighton Esplanade,
and Ms Amott asked:
Question
Since the implementation of the new bus zone along Brighton Beach esplanade this area is
not being utilised by buses sufficiently to justify the great inconvenience and restriction to
Bayside rate payers access to the beach. Would council reconsider this parking zone
restriction to allow greater access for the rate payers to enjoy the beach?
Response from the CEO
Council is currently collecting data on traffic and parking movements in the vicinity of Dendy
Beach Pavilion and will use this data to refine parking controls.

11. Reports by Delegates
1. Association of Bayside Municipalities – The Director Environment, Recreation and
Infrastructure advised that the Manager Open Space and Recreation attended the
Association of Bayside Municipalities (ABM) meeting held on 13 February 2025. The
primary discussion at the meeting was to bring new Councillors in attendance up to date
on the ABM, its purpose, Charter and current state of play. Key items included:
• a motion regarding eligibility given that Bayside and Frankston councils do not
have Councillor representatives, which necessitated a change to allow nominated
council delegates to vote in elections and to be eligible to stand for a position on
the Executive Committee. This motion was passed

Cr Sarah O’Donnell from City of Kingston being elected Vice President.
