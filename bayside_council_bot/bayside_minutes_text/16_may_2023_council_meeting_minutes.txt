Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
6. Public Question Time
1. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a question regarding fossil fuel subsidies,
and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
Bayside Council has declared a climate emergency and has a plan to achieve net
zero emissions, meanwhile our Federal Independent MP Zoe Daniel has voted in
Federal Parliament for new fossil fuel subsidies.
a) Are new fossil fuel subsidies supported by our Federal MP consistent with
Bayside Council calling for a climate emergency and its plan for net zero
emissions?
b) Does Bayside Council disagree with our Federal Independent MP, Zoe Daniel,
voting for new fossil fuel subsidies?
Response from the CEO
a) Bayside City Council’s declaration of a climate emergency on 17 December
2019 recognises the need for urgent, meaningful action on human-induced
climate change at all levels of government, including local government.
Council is focussing on delivering the Climate Emergency Action Plan which
includes a range of actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in response
to the climate emergency.
Any views of the Federal Member’s position on fossil fuel subsidies should be
taken up directly with the Member.
b) It is not the role of Council to disagree or agree with the local Federal
Member’s views on the matter.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
2. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson has asked a further question regarding redactions
made to a question submitted to the February Council Meeting.
A third question from Mr Wilson was also received; however, Council’s Governance
Rules allow for a maximum of 2 questions per individual to each meeting. Council
has however written to Mr Wilson on this matter.
The second question is as follows:
Question
To the February meeting of Council a question was submitted about the attendance
of our Federal Member for Goldstein’s attendance at Australia Day Citizenship
Ceremonies. When the question was submitted it included the word “boycott”, but
when asked the word “boycott” was removed. Is it the policy of Council to censor
questions from ratepayers to Council?
Response from the CEO
Division 8, Section 57(9)(d) of Council’s Governance Rules states that a question (or
part thereof) may be disallowed by the Chief Executive Officer (or, at the Meeting, by
the Chair) if the Chief Executive Officer or Chair determines that it is aimed at
embarrassing a Councillor or a member of Council staff. This can reasonably be
extended to apply to members of parliament or any members of the community. It is
therefore appropriate that some questions be redacted or disallowed entirely from
public question time.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
3. Mr Warwick Dean
Mr Warwick Dean submitted a question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre project,
and Mr Dean asked:
Question
What evidence can council provide where they have communicated to residents
about the likely traffic, light spill and noise impacts from the operation of the Netball
Centre in Holloway Road as referred to in the Special Council Meeting minutes on
the 25th February 2021, page 21?
Response from the CEO
The agenda for the 25 February 2021 Special Meeting of Council at page 21 outlines
that ‘Whilst the project is not subject to a town planning permit application process,
both the Council and VSBA have communicated with residents on the likely traffic,
light spill and noise impacts from such a development. A comprehensive community
engagement process was carried out by Council and is summarised in the first
section of this paper and Attachment 1 and 2.’
The Community Engagement Summary Report, an attachment to the agenda,
outlines the methods undertaken by Council in doing so.
4. Mr Warwick Dean
Mr Warwick Dean submitted a further question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre
project, and Mr Dean asked:
Question
After having received verbal advice from a Bayside Council employee (on Monday 7
November 2022) that residents of Holloway Road and connected streets are to be
directly surveyed by BCC about parking signage related to traffic management and
parking related to the Bayside/State Government Netball facility, what actions has
BCC implemented to implement this advice?
Response from the CEO
In December 2020, Council undertook community consultation on the Bayside
Netball Centre to gather community feedback to inform the hours of operation,
mitigation strategies for noise, and the draft traffic management plan.
Council considered community feedback and endorsed the Traffic Management Plan
at its Special Council Meeting on 25 February 2021. The Plan recommends on-street
parking restrictions, prioritisation of resident (permit) parking and school drop-off/
pick-up zones, onsite parking, and speed reduction treatments.
Signage required to implement the restrictions recommended within the endorsed
Traffic Management Plan is expected to be installed in September/October this year,
in advance of the Centre opening.
Residents will be provided with timely information about zone details and applying for
their parking permits in advance of the signage installation.
Page No. 9

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
Council will undertake a traffic management review six months after the Centre
officially opens to ensure that local parking needs are being met.
5. Mr James Atkinson
Mr James Atkinson submitted a question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre project,
and Mr Atkinson asked:
Question
How do you intend to engage with the local community to get its input into the
operation of the Netball Centre in Holloway Road?
Response from the CEO
In December 2020, Council undertook community consultation on the Bayside
Netball Centre to gather community feedback to inform the hours of operation,
mitigation strategies for noise, and the draft traffic management plan.
As part of the planning of the netball centre, key aspects of the use have been
considered and decided, including the hours and days of operation, the design of the
facility and the traffic and pedestrian improvements required to support the operation
of the facility.
6. Mrs Anita Reynolds
Mrs Anita Reynolds submitted a question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre project,
and Mrs Reynolds asked:
Question
Given the significant change to the usage of Holloway Road, what measures have
council put in place to ensure the safety of drivers, pedestrians, dog walkers, school
children, scouts, cyclists and residents?
Response from the CEO
As part of Road Safety Audit, a number of actions were identified to ensure that
pedestrian and other user safety was considered. Those actions, including a raised
pedestrian crossing, upgraded lighting, speed humps and other traffic controls will be
delivered as recommended by the Road Safety Audit closer to the opening of the
facility.
The traffic assessment report prepared for the project suggested changes such as
restricting access to Holloway Road by introducing one-way traffic within the car park
which will exit to Wangara Road. Additional parking restrictions are being introduced
including No Stopping restrictions where needed for safe traffic movement. It is also
proposed to extend the lower 40km/h speed limit to the eastern end of Holloway
Road as part of the project.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
7. Mr Paul Lauritz
Mr Paul Lauritz submitted a question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre project, and
Mr Lauritz asked:
Question
In the recommendations made in the minutes of the Special Council Meeting on the
25th February 2021, point 5d states “that council explores an option to include a
noise barrier on the south of the project site adjacent to Holloway Road”, can you
give evidence of what options you have explored for the provision of a noise barrier
on the south side of the project site of Holloway Road?
Response from the CEO
In response to the Acoustic Report prepared by Stantec in February 2021,
amendments were made to the design of the facility which provides appropriate
buffering to reduce noise levels travelling across Holloway and Wangara Roads.
8. Mr Brett Dyer
Mr Brett Dyer submitted a question regarding Bayside’s Netball Centre project. As
the question contains more than 2 parts, only the first 2 parts of the question have
been answered in accordance with Council’s Governance Rules. Mr Dyer asked:
Question
In your Summary and Conclusion of the Special Council Meeting held on the 25th
February 2021, it was recorded that “it is acknowledged that while officers have and
will continue to attempt to reduce any impacts on local residents that some of these
impacts will still remain”. Given this statement and the fact that the Bayside Council
have saved $8.85million on the Netball project,
a) is it reasonable that a proportion of that $8.85 million rate payer savings is
used to reduce the remaining impact on local residents surrounded by the
Netball courts?
b) How do council propose to do this?
Response from the CEO
The design of the facility has considered opportunities to mitigate the impact on
residential amenity for nearby property owners. By utilising the Sandringham
Secondary College site, it has resulted in savings of almost $9 million as outlined in
the 25 February 2021 report to Council. This does not suggest that those are savings
to be invested in further mitigation measures for nearby residents.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 16 May 2023
9. Mr Chris Sutton
Mr Chris Sutton submitted a question regarding the leasing of open space and sports
pavilions in Bayside, and Mr Sutton asked:
Question
Does Council require sporting clubs leasing open space and/or sports pavilions to
annually provide the number of their members that are Bayside residents and non-
Bayside residents.
Response from the CEO
As part of Council’s twice-yearly seasonal allocation process, incoming tenants are
required to provide information relating to the number of members per each postcode
within the City of Bayside, as well as the total number of ‘other’ postcodes. Several
postcodes, for example, postcode 3192, relate to suburbs split across both Bayside
and adjoining municipalities.
10. Mr Chris Sutton
Mr Chris Sutton submitted a further question. The questions relates to access to
open space, and Mr Sutton asked:
Question
How does council ensure residents are provided equitable access to open space for
passive recreation on grounds leased to sporting clubs with an unreasonably large
number of non-resident members.
Response from the CEO
Public open space is used for a range of purposes and Council must balance the
needs of both formal and informal park users. Informal, passive recreation in parks
can occur at almost any reserve across Bayside, whereas structured sport is only
able to be accommodated on grounds designed for the particular use.
Most Council reserves provide a balance of both structured and unstructured
recreation. Sporting grounds are allocated for structured sport during particular times,
with other times available for other uses.
The Bayside Open Space Strategy 2012 notes that on average, 80% of light use
hours for sportsgrounds were available for use by the wider community, with 20%
dedicated to formal sporting use.

11. Mr James Dargan
Mr James Dargan submitted a question regarding Council Meeting process, and Mr
Dargan asked:
Question
Why are key discussion points not recorded in the Council Meeting Minutes ?
Response from the CEO
There is no requirement in Council’s Governance Rules, nor would it be practical, to
record individual discussion points raised by Councillors during debate. Council
meetings are however live-streamed and recordings are archived for the public on
Council’s website.
