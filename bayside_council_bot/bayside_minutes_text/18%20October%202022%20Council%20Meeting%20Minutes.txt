66. . Public Question PTime ublic Question Time
1. Ms Helen Tachos
Ms Helen Tachos submitted a question regarding footpaths and the community access
facilities in Bayside, and Ms Tachos asked:
Question
a) With our rates increasing by the maximum allowable amount each year, when will
residents located in East Brighton (Alex Del Porto's Bleazby ward which borders
Nepean Hwy- North Rd- Union Street- Centre Rd and Hawthorn Rd ) start seeing
some investment in our area on footpaths and a dedicated council facility for the
community to use and for council office?
b) The last time we met with the council they advised the Anglers club was available in 3
years as kindergartens are utilising this whilst upgrades are occurring to existing
kindergartens. Is it reasonable to wait for 3 years for a community space and fair
when you compare masses of expenditure in building/sporting works, in Hampton,
Brighton, Sandringham and Beaumaris?
Response from the CEO
a) Council’s investment in footpaths is guided by its Road Management Plan which was
adopted by Council on 15 June 2021. This public document is a requirement under
the Road Management Act 2004 and it outlines the decision making framework on
which footpaths are inspected, maintained and selected for renewal across Bayside.
In 2023, $2.5 million is being spent on renewal and upgrade of footpaths across
Bayside, including renewal in Stone Street, Brighton East.
a) North Brighton Occasional Care is currently located at the building formerly occupied
by the Anglers Club, while the North Brighton Children’s Centre is undergoing
building works. The works are anticipated to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.
The building will be vacant from this time, and Council will work with the community to
identify the need and best use of the site. Council is currently progressing on the
future of Billilla as a community venue in Bleazby Ward. Council has also recently
introduced an approach to make Pavilions more accessible when not required for
sporting purposes. This will add further capacity for community groups to find venues
in future.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 October 2022
2. Mr Michael Heffernan
Mr Michael Heffernan submitted a question regarding a Supreme Court matter between
Brighton Foreshore Association and Council, and Mr Heffernan asked:
Question
As it is now just over a year since the Appeal Court of the Victorian Supreme Court ordered
the Brighton Foreshore Association to pay the legal costs of $278000 incurred by Bayside
Council in defending the Brighton Foreshore Association’s appeal against the building of the
Dendy Street Life Saving Club, my question is
(a) Has the Brighton Foreshore Association actually acknowledged that they owe the
Bayside Council and its residents the sum of $278000– which are the legal costs
incurred by the Bayside Council in defending the Victorian Supreme Court Appeal
action brought by the losing party in the matter the Brighton Foreshore Association
(b) If the answer to the above question is yes when can Council expect to receive the
funds, or if the answer is No can Bayside Council now commence legal proceedings
against the Brighton Foreshore Association to recover the legally sanctioned amount
that it owes to Bayside Council and its residents.
Response from the CEO
Consent Orders are currently being sought through the Courts to confirm the quantum that
would be payable to Bayside City Council in relation to the Supreme Court and Appeals
Court hearings.
Council is not in a position to seek the payment of any costs until the Courts have issued the
above sought orders.
3. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question regarding Council’s audited accounts for 2021–
22, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
In Note 9.2 to the audited accounts for 2021-22, Council reported a combined surplus of
income, which was greater than its expenses, of $43.047million.
(a) How much of this surplus was attributed to income from the General Rate, and
(b) How much of the surplus was attributable to Own-source Revenue?
Response from the CEO
Mr Reynolds is referring to the reconciliation of the statement of cash flows which shows a
cash surplus from operations of $51.089 million which is used to fund Council’s capital and
financing expenditure of $55.718 million. The statement of cash flows on page 124 of the
report confirms this resulted in a cash deficit of $4.629 million for the year. Council does not
separate its cash surplus from operations between general rates and own source revenue.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 October 2022
4. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question regarding Council’s audited accounts for
2021-22, and Mr Reynolds asked:
In Note 5.2(b) to the 2022 accounts, Council reported that a sum of $18.05 million had been
paid to Sandringham College to purchase Right of Use Assets. and
These assets are to be amortised over the 21 years of the leasing contract. This will set the
minimum rental to be recovered by Council, from its sub-tenants, of more than $1million per
year,
(a) Has Council managed to find a tenant or tenants who have agreed to pay a sufficient
rental for Council to be compliant with s 111 1(a) of the Local Government Act 2020
(b) Has Sandringham College been advised of the provisions of the accounting standards
AASB 15 and AASB 16 that require the undepreciated value of the Right of Use Assets to be
returned to the lessee if and when the lease is surrendered for any reason?
Response from the CEO
(a) Council has not entered into a beneficial enterprise pursuant to section 110 of the
Local Government Act 2020 that would give rise to a requirement to comply with
section 111 1(a).
(b) There is no requirement for VSBA to return the undepreciated value of the right of
use asset if the 21-year community use agreement was to terminate early.
5. Mr Sam Seoud
Mr Sam Seoud submitted a question regarding disabled parking in Bayside, and Mr Seoud
asked:
Question
I believe there are a total of 3 'disabled parking spots' on the Church St Shopping Strip in
Bayside. Could the Bayside City Council or the Councillors Of Bayside please explain to me
in what way these spots are considered accessible or disability friendly?? This needs to be
addressed as a matter of urgency.
Response from the CEO
The Church Street Activity Centre contains a total of 12 disabled parking spaces. This
consists of eight spaces located in off-street parking areas and four spaces located in on-
street parking areas on Church Street. Council acknowledges that improvements need to be
made to these spaces and plans to undertake works to ensure that all on-street disabled
parking spaces within Church Street are brought up to specification with the current
Australian Standard for accessible and disabled parking in early 2023.
