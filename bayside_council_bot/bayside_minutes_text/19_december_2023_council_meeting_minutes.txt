6. Public Question Time
1. Ms Mary Basic
Ms Mary Basic submitted a question related to a recent planning decision concerning
47 South Road, Brighton, and Ms Basic asked:
Question
I would like know whether Council intends to object to the scale and over
development of the Xavier land. Also how they perceive to manage traffic ingress
and egress onto New St. Does the development fall within permeability requirements,
setbacks, height limits, on-site parking for resident and visitor ratios.
Response from the CEO
Council’s Planning and Amenity Delegate Committee determined to refuse the
planning application for the development of the land at 47 South Road, Brighton at its
meeting of 11 December 2023. Should an application for review be lodged with the
Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, representations will be made by Bayside
City Council to support its position.
2. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a question related to funding for
infrastructure projects, and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
Following our Federal Member for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, voting to defund $100m of
Federal infrastructure grants for our community, can Council (advise) whether these
projects remain a priority for the next Federal election, and/or what projects it will
seek funding for the next Federal election?
Response from the CEO
The Federal Government has committed $15.5M to the transformation of Yalukit
Willam Nature Reserve with the project expected to be delivered from 2023–24 to
2026–27.
In the lead up to the next Federal Election, Council will identify funding opportunities
which are compatible with its strategic asset plans and planned infrastructure.

3. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a question related to Council’s advocacy
priorities for the next federal election and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
Now that it has been revealed in Parliament our Federal Member for Goldstein, Zoe
Daniel, voted for $2 billion of new coal subsidies, can Council advise whether its
funding priorities for the next Federal election will include additional measures to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
Response from the CEO
Council made a declaration of climate emergency in June 2019, firmly recognising
that the people of Bayside are at risk of the impacts of climate change.
Council has yet to determine its precise advocacy priorities for the next federal
election.
4. Ms J. Glass
Ms J. Glass submitted a question related to the new basketball courts at Tulip Street,
Cheltenham, and Ms Glass asked:
Question
When will the 4 new basketball courts at Tulip Street Cheltenham be opened, and
why did the Council unveil a plaque pertaining to its opening in November 2023?
Response from the CEO
The new basketball courts at Tulip Street were officially opened on 2 November 2023
following completion of works. Following the defect period, the facility has now been
handed to the Southern Basketball Association to operate. Council understands the
Southern Basketball Association will open the facility to the public in January 2024.

5. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to notices issued in respect of
Council’s Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
Council enforcement officers have issued me with a Notice to Comply, quoting a
breach of clause 13 of Neighborhood Amenity Local Law 2021. This law cites, at
clause 3, "Council's power to make this Local Law is contained in section 111 of the
Local Government Act 1989 and section 42 of the Domestic Animals Act 1994".
(a) Why is Council continuing to operate this Local Law when section 111 of the
Local Government Act 1989 expired on 30th June 2021, the day before the Local
Law came into operation, AND,
(b) Is the Mayor and Councilors planning to order the recall of all notices issued
under Neighborhood Local Law 2021, since 1st July 2021, together with the refund of
fines, fees and cost recovery charges claimed since its claimed commencement.
Response from the CEO
Part A
Council’s Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021 was made lawfully as required by
the Local Government Act 1989 and adopted by Council on 15 June 2021. The Local
Law continues to operate for 10 years after the date of commencement being 1 July
2021.
Part B
Notices issued under the Local Law are valid and therefore there are no grounds to
recall notices as suggested.
6. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Council’s power to make Local
Laws, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
The High Court of Australia has recently reminded us, that Governments, including
Local Governments, does not have power to make Laws; valid Laws are made by
Parliament only.
(a) Is the Mayor and Councilors now planning to review the suitability of laws and
regulations it uses, (particularly the accounting laws), to identify any legal and
financial risk it may be exposed to, AND,
(b) When does Council plan to change its traditional accounting practice of ignoring
Own-source Revenue, when presenting its accounting statements.
Response from the CEO
Council complies with the requirements of the Local Government Act, Local
Government Reporting regulations and Australian Accounting Standards pertaining
to accounting practices and financial reporting.

7. Mr Angus Morrison
Mr Angus Morrison submitted a question in relation the potential removal of car parks
and closure of roads as part of Council’s Open Space Strategy, and Mr Morrison
asked:
Question
Prior to any potential removal of car-parks and closure of roads as part of the
Council’s open space strategy, what are the details of stakeholder engagement
undertaken by Bayside Council such as the number of people surveyed, the
questions asked, the proximity of the ratepayers surveyed to the car-parks and roads
in question and the results?
Response from the CEO
A report presented to the 20 December 2022 Council Meeting explored a number of
sites where the creation of new open space was possible, with the reporting including
a section of Church Street as a possible option. Any decision on this will be subject to
community consultation as part of the Open Space Strategy.
Council is commencing its review of the Bayside Open Space Strategy 2012 in early
2024. As the review of the Strategy has not commenced, this has not been tested
with the community and no decision has been made at this point.
8. Mr Angus Morrison
Mr Angus Morrison submitted a further question in relation the potential removal of
car parks and closure of roads as part of Council’s open space strategy, and Mr
Morrison asked:
Question
Prior to any potential closure of car-parks and closure of roads as part of the
Council’s open space strategy, what economic impact studies are undertaken by
Council relating to these proposed changes, including the impacts on neighbouring
businesses most affected due to their location.
Response from the CEO
Council is commencing its review of the Bayside Open Space Strategy 2012 in early
2024. As the review of the Strategy has not commenced, this has not been tested
with the community and no decision has been made.
Any actions identified within the future strategy will be subject to community
consultation prior to Council adopting a new Strategy.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 December 2023
9. Deborah Albrecht
Ms Deborah Albrecht submitted a question in relation to car spaces and speed limits
as related within Council’s open space strategy, and Ms Albrecht asked:
Question
Is the council really planning to remove car spaces and close areas to cars and is
council planning to introduce 30km an hour zones (for safety ... or blatant revenue
earning?) Cars are a necessity in our lives and all this will do is create chaos through
traffic jams, time delays, frustration and anger.
Response from the CEO
A report presented to the December 2022 Council Meeting explored a number of
sites where the creation of new open space was possible, with the reporting including
a section of Church Street as a possible option.
Council is commencing its review of the Open Space Strategy in early 2024. As the
review of the Strategy has not commenced, this has not been tested with the
community and no decision has been made.
There are no current plans to lower speed limits in the Church Street area.

3. Inner South Metropolitan Mayors’ Forum – The Mayor, Cr Fiona Stitfold indicated that

4. South East Councils Climate Change Alliance – Cr Clarke Martin submitted a written
report as follows:
The Councillor Advisory Group (CAG) held its final meeting on Thursday 7 December
with a very strong attendance of both officers and Councillors. The current workplan
report was presented which remains on track.
After a very successful election advocacy campaign last year Minister of Climate Action
Victoria, Lily DÁmbrosio MP and her Department Secretary attended the SECCCA CEO
& Councillors networking Breakfast. During this occasion the key objectives of SECCCA
which are also Bayside’s were acknowledged and in fact highlighted by the Minister as
examples of what needs to be replicated and enhanced across Victoria. After years of
advocacy this type of engagement is extremely important.
Also of note, Council’s Manager Climate Waste and Integrated Transport and the Climate
and Environment Sustainability Coordinator have provided the following updates of two
projects that Bayside has benefited in over the past 2 to 3 years.
Asset Vulnerability Project
The Asset Vulnerability Assessment project provides Council with access to climate
change data relating to heat vulnerability/dryness, inundation and storm surge and their
potential impacts on Council buildings and assets. The data includes 2030, 2050 and
2070 climate scenario models.
The outputs of the project are being embedded in project lifecycle planning to ensure
design and delivery of Council’s buildings and infrastructure projects consider future
impacts of heat vulnerability/dryness, inundation and storm surge. There has also been
an initial assessment conducted on Council’s buildings using the tool which identified the
top 30 sites at risk of climate change impacts. This information will be considered through
future strategic asset management. The ultimate goal will be to attribute a vulnerability
rating to assets and identify adaptation options that may increase asset resilience.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 December 2023
Further information can be found here: Asset Vulnerability Assessment
Enhancing Community Resilience (Part funded by the Mindaroo Foundation)
The Enhancing Community Resilience Project aims to prepare communities in Bayside
for current and future changes to the climate including increased flood, coastal erosion
and heat waves. It will provide practical actions, tools, and resources so Council can
proactively support communities to act prior, during and after disasters. Specifically,
Council is focusing on our over-65 cohort, developing a toolkit through a co-design
process, aimed at building resilience by preparing ahead for extreme weather. The tool
kit will allow older residents to identify early risks using a self-assessment tool and have
a plan in place to improve resilience to heat. It will help older residents to identify their
own needs, self-assess the resilience of their own locations, know what is needed for a
cooler or drier place, and finally what their triggers are for needing to move or change
what they are doing. The project brief will soon be provided to the consultants who will
meet again with the older volunteer resident/s to develop the assessment criteria and
associated collateral.
