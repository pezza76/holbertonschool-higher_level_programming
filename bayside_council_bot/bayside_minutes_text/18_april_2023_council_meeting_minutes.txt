6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question regarding sports pavilions in Bayside and accessibility,
and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
Part 1 - What are the locations, timings and project status of each of the remaining sports
pavilions to be upgraded in Bayside?
Part 2 - Which of the remaining sports pavilions to be upgraded in Bayside will include
changing places bathrooms accessible from outside the building with an MLAK key so they
can be used at any time by those who need them?
Response from the CEO
Part 1
Council is currently completing works at RJ Sillitoe Reserve pavilion redevelopment,
expected to be completed in mid-2023.
Also under construction are Brighton Life Saving Club Pavilion and the Black Rock Life
Saving Club Pavilion. It is anticipated that the Brighton Life Saving Club will be completed
mid-2023 and the Black Rock Life Saving Club expected to be completed in late 2024 or
early 2025.
Works to the Boss James Reserve Pavilion are currently in the design stage, with
construction expected to commence mid-2023. The Dendy Park Athletics and Soccer
Pavilion redevelopment is currently at the design stage and is expected to be completed by
June 2025.
There are a further 5 pavilions to be constructed between 2026 and 2028. Details of these
will be provided in the written response to Mr Naylor.

2. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a further question. The question is regarding inclusive playgrounds
in Bayside and, and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
Part 1 Will council commit to building just its 2nd inclusive playground of its 61
playgrounds portfolio at WRR including tables, chairs, rotunda, bbq's etc to
enable and encourage community participation?
Part 2 If not Wilson Rec Reserve, what is council's plans for a second inclusive
playground including location and timing?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Bayside is well serviced with 61 playgrounds of varying size and condition
throughout the municipality. The Bayside Playground Improvement Plan 2015–25
outlines a plan to upgrade or replace all playgrounds over the 10 years with a
total investment of $10.3M.
The Playground Improvement Plan does not provide for a fully accessible
playground at Wilson Reserve.
Part 2 There are no current plans for a second fully accessible playground in Bayside.
3. Mr John Brady
Mr John Brady submitted a question regarding Davie Lane, Brighton, and Mr Brady asked:
Question
What Capital Works priorities need amending, so Davie Lane, Brighton up-grade is included
in Budget 2023–24?
Response from the CEO
Council faces many competing demands for funding of a wide range of projects, not all of
which can be funded immediately.
Davie Lane works have been included in the proposed capital program for 2024–25.
To shift the Davie Lane project to 2023–24 would require Council to defer a project similar
value that is currently costed in 2023–24.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 April 2023
6. Mr John Lyons
Mr John Lyons submitted a question regarding the Bayside Netball Centre project, and Mr
Lyons asked:
Question
Part 1 Could it be construed that Council and management may have been complicit in
potentially endangering people's lives by rushing ahead with the manufacture of
the Netball Complex.
Part 2 And; as several residents in the Balmoral housing precinct have come down with
serious illnesses, could the land under those homes and surrounds be
contaminated?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The former Golf Driving Range at Wangara Road is subject to Environmental
Action Notices which require ongoing risks from the site to continue to be
monitored.
Part 2 Council’s independent environmental assessor undertook analysis of current
monitoring (including outside of the site boundaries) to understand whether there
is a risk of contamination. Testing indicates that there is low risk of contamination
beyond the site boundaries. Council will continue to monitor conditions both
inside and outside of the site to ensure there is no risk to public safety.
7. Mr Andrew McLeod
Mr Andrew McLeod submitted a question regarding Council’s position on a First Nations
Voice to Parliament, and Mr McLeod asked:
Question
Part 1 Please explain how you can justify any of your time and any potential rate payer
funds on a federal political matter
Part 2 Please explain why your individual political opinions should be shared with the
Bayside community and why your actions are not exploiting your position for your
own political purposes.
Response from the CEO
Part 1 In the lead up to the Voice referendum, Council is affirming a previously endorsed
commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, as unanimously voted by
Council on 17 August 2021.
Part 2 Council will share information to assist electors to understand the importance,
purpose and process of the Voice referendum, and to mitigate misinformation.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 18 April 2023
8. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question regarding rates, and Mr Howard asked:
Question
In the 2022/23 Budget Council forecast a Rate increase of 2% for the 2023/24 financial year.
Part 1 At a time when residents are experiencing unprecedented cost of living
increases, why has Council abandoned its previous 2% forecast and proposed a
3.5% rate increase?
Part 2 Given that many residents are making sacrifices to balance the household
budget, why is Council not reducing or delaying expenditure so that a rate
increase can be avoided?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The 2022–23 budget included a forecast rate increase for 2023–24 of 2% in line
with the Department of Treasury forecasts for CPI at that time. Since then, CPI
has increased to 7.8% as at December 2022 and is expected to be 4% in 2023–
24. It is Council policy to increase rates each year in line with the rate cap set by
the Minister which is 3.5% for 2023–24.
Part 2 The rate increase funds over 100 important services to the community as well as
a capital program which is required to maintain the quality of Council assets and
deliver much needed community infrastructure.
9. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question regarding infringement notices issues in relation to
unregistered dogs, and Mr Howard asked:
Question
In response to a question at the last meeting, Council said that the location of infringement
notices issued to dog owners was not recorded in the Council database and only the dog
owners home address was recorded.
Part 1 Does this mean that if a dog owner from another municipality challenges an
infringement notice issued by Bayside City Council, Council is not able to say
where the infringement was detected?
Part 2 During 2022 how many infringement notices for unregistered dogs did Council
issue to owners of dogs whose address was in Port Phillip LGA?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 For challenged infringements, Council can establish where the offence was
detected based on the specific investigation evidence.
Part 2 Council did not issue any infringements for unregistered dogs from Port Phillip
LGA in 2022. Consistent with Section 10(1) of the Domestic Animals Act 1994,
identified unregistered dogs not kept in Bayside are referred to the relevant Local
Government Authority of the Municipal District where the dog is kept, for
investigation and appropriate action.
