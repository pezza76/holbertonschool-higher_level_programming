Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 May 2025
The Mayor declared the Council Meeting open at 6.30pm and advised members of the public
gallery that the meeting is being recorded and streamed live on the internet to enhance the
accessibility of Council meetings to the broader Bayside community.
The Mayor invited The Acting CEO to read the prayer.
1. Prayer
The Acting CEO read the prayer at the commencement of the meeting.
O God
Bless this City, Bayside,
Give us courage, strength and wisdom,
So that our deliberations,
May be for the good of all,
Amen
Minute’s silence
The Mayor asked the gallery to observe a minute’s silence to acknowledge the recent
passing of Mr John Knight, former Mayor and Councillor.
The gallery observed a minute’s silence
John Knight served a term at Strathbogie Shire Council, before selling his farm and moving
to Bayside. He was elected as a Councillor for the Moysey Ward during the 2005 to 2008
term and served as Mayor for the 2006–07 Council year. John was involved in many
community organisations including as founder of the Bayside Men's Shed.
2. Acknowledgement of Country
The Acting CEO read the Acknowledgement of Country.
 Bayside City Council proudly acknowledges the Bunurong People of the Kulin
Nation as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of this land, and we pay our
respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging as well as any Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander community members with us today.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 May 2025
6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Charles Conroy submitted a question related to parking restrictions on Balmoral
Avenue, and Mr Conroy asked:
Question
Given that the 2024 Traffic Assessment Report concluded there are no significant safety or
traffic issues on Balmoral Avenue, that the endorsed Traffic Impact Assessment did not
recommend changes to the street, and that the proposal contradicts both the Bayside Parking
Strategy and Planning Scheme objectives of residential amenity and equitable access
Can Council explain why it is proposing full-time No Stopping restrictions on Balmoral Avenue,
compromising resident amenity, and will it consider withdrawing the proposal or at least explore
other solutions before proceeding further?
Response from the Acting CEO
A community concern was received from a resident of Balmoral Avenue that vehicles parking
on-street were causing congestion and safety issues. Balmoral Avenue does not have
sufficient road width for vehicles to park opposite each other while maintaining sufficient width
for through traffic. The proposal which was circulated maintained the PERMIT ZONE parking
on one side of the street and sought feedback on the removal of the 1P parking on the other
side. The feedback from the consultation has been compiled and due to strong resident
opposition, the proposal will not proceed.
2. Ms Lesley Winning submitted a question related to beach restrictions, and Ms
Winning asked:
Question
Why are the beach restrictions for Rickett's Point south being changed to no dog access at all
in summer?
Response from the Acting CEO
The proposed restrictions have been developed based on the extensive public consultation
process undertaken. The intention of the new restrictions is to reduce the number of different
zones that apply across Ricketts Point (from 5 down to 3 zones) and to balance the diverse
set of community needs including for dog-on and dog-off leash areas, dog-free beach areas
and protecting flora and fauna. There will continue to be an all-year dog-off leash area within
Ricketts Point as proposed and an all-year on-leash access to the North, which is part of the
proposition this evening.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 May 2025
3. Ms Anna Y. submitted a question related to proposed dog restrictions, and Ms Y
asked:
Question
Council’s recent email on proposed dog restrictions attached a map which designated the area
east of the Brighton baths as ‘Sandown Beach’ and gave it a yellow marking to designate ‘off
leash at all times’.
Part 1 Is Council extending the current dog beach area all the way down to the Brighton
baths/pier?
Part 2 Can Council clarify the boundaries of the dog beach and confirm that the area east of
baths (towards CBD) up to dog beach is not part of the dog beach.
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 The existing boundary of the dog-off leash area referred to as Sandown Beach Dog
Park will remain the same from Sandown Street to Bay Street.
Part 2 There is no proposal to extend the current dog-off leash area beyond its existing
boundary from Sandown Street to Bay Street. Specifically, the area from Normanby
Street to Sandown Street, including the areas outside Middle Brighton Baths and Royal
Brighton Yacht Club is not intended to be included in the dog-off leash area.
4. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a question related to Sandringham Leisure Centre,
and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
Given that Council is spending $1.1 million on remedial works for the Sandringham Leisure
Centre, how many years will this extend the facility's life by?
Response from the Acting CEO
The remedial works to Sandringham Leisure Centre will extend the facility’s remaining useful
life by approximately 10 years.
Page No. 8

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 May 2025
5. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a further question related to Council’s Warm Water
Pool project, and Ms Bentley asked:
Question
Part 1 In Council's proposed Budget the Warm Water Pool project has been deferred
indefinitely, pending a review of the Sandringham Leisure Centre. If the decision is
made to demolish and rebuild, how many years will lapse before Council can afford the
$80 -$100 million required?
Part 2 Does this mean that Bayside will be without a Warm Water Pool for this length of time?
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 The Sandringham Family Leisure Centre (SFLC) pool has a remaining useful life of up
to 10 years and Council’s budget and long-term financial plan cannot accommodate
both a new warm water pool facility and a new or redeveloped Sandringham Family
Leisure Centre. As part of the 2025–26 Budget, Council has proposed the deferral of
the warm water pool project pending the outcomes of an aquatics strategy to be
undertaken in 2025–26 which will determine its overall approach to meet the
community’s aquatic needs.
Part2 The answer to this question relies on the work which will be undertaken through the
Aquatics Strategy, proposed to be developed in 2025–26. Prior to that Strategy being
completed, it would be premature to comment on the multiple scenarios that may arise
in relation to timing of a new or upgraded aquatic facility.
6. Ms Elizabeth Allan submitted a question related to the Highett Common project, and
Ms Allan asked:
Question
Residents of Donald Street are highly concerned about the 1,000+ apartment Development -
‘Highett Commons’ and the recent changes made to the Middleton Street access road. Last
week the developer Sunkin widened this access road which was approved as a ‘single
lane/Exit Only’ in the Development Plan. Has Council investigated these changes and can
council ensure two-way traffic will NOT be permitted into the Neighbourhood Residential Zone
via Middleton Street?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council officers have been made aware of this and are currently investigating whether the
works that have been undertaken are in accordance with the Development Plan approval.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 20 May 2025
7. Mr Jeremy Wood submitted a question related to animal management, and Mr Wood
asked:
Question
Dog Waste Bins
Part 1 - Location and Cost
How many dog waste stations does the City of Bayside have and where are their locations,
what is the cost of establishing each dog waste station and what are the ongoing operating
and maintenance costs?
Part 2 : Measurable Outcomes
What quantifiable reduction in dog waste can be measured or other possible positive
behavioural change on the part of dog owners can be identified as a result of this initiative?
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 The dispensers cost Council between $180 to 200 each to purchase and are usually
installed directly onto existing bin surroundings or infrastructure. There are 50 of these
dispensers currently installed within Bayside.
(*further response provided after the Council meeting):
The dispensers are refilled 2 to 3 times per week depending on the location and during
busy periods such as school holidays, public holidays, and in summer, and are
monitored and refilled more frequently if necessary.
The cost for the bags is between $72,000 to $75,000 per annum, and the ongoing
labour costs for refilling the dispensers is approximately $26,000 per annum.
Part 2 (*response provided after the Council meeting):
Council has not undertaken research into potential links between the provision of dog
waste stations and behavioural change and therefore cannot provide any quantitative
evidence around the same.
The number of dispensers has increased from 75 in 2016 to 91 in 2024, and the number
of dog bags utilised has also subsequently increased from 1,977,000 to approximately
3,000,000. The number of registered dogs in Bayside has also increased in this period
from 12,372 to 12,789.
8. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question related to animal management, and Mr
Howard asked:
Question
Part 1. In 2024, how many dogs and cats were detected in Bayside, over the age of three
months, that had never been registered in Bayside, or in another Council area?
Part 2. In 2024, how many fines were issued to Bayside pet owners whose animal was
registered, but they failed or forgot to renew their dog or cat registration?
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 Council detected approximately 97 new dogs and cats unregistered in 2024.
Part 2 Council issued 436 infringement notices to pet owners for failure to renew their pet
registration.

9. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question related to animal management, and Mr
Howard asked:
Question
Part 1. In 2024, how many people were fined by Council for not picking up after their dog?
Part 2. Does Council have statistical data on where dog and cat related infringements occur?
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 No person was fined in 2024 for not picking up after their dog in 2024.
Part 2 Council has a record of all infringement data; however, this may not be easily
accessible due to the nature of the reporting and may take time to consolidate.
