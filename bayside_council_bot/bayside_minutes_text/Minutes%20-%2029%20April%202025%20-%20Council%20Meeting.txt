Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question related to sport pavilions for Brighton Beach and
Trevor Barker ovals, and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
Part 1 Why is council announcing federal political party funding for sport pavilions for Brighton
Beach & Trevor Barker ovals via the Mayor’s council Facebook page. How does this
comply with Council’s Governance rules?
Part 2 Will the planned sport pavilions at Brighton Beach and Trevor Barker ovals have a
changing places bathrooms in their respective builds? If not, why does council not
include suitable public bathrooms for everyone?
Response from the Acting CEO
Part 1 Advocating to state and federal governments to help meet the needs of our community
is an essential role of local government. This advocacy is particularly public in the lead
up to an election.
Council is currently seeking action on a range of initiatives from a future Australian
Government including funding for important community infrastructure.
The Mayor Cr Hanna El Mouallem has contacted all candidates for the Division of
Goldstein and provided them with information on Bayside’s advocacy priorities.
Council’s advocacy also includes acknowledging election pledges via Council’s
communication channels including social media, in accordance with our protocols. We
are also recording election pledges on Bayside’s advocacy priorities on Council’s
website.
Part 2 Changing Places are important facilities to meet the needs of people with complex
disabilities and their carers to plan and enjoy various activities throughout Bayside. In
line with the endorsed Public Toilet Strategy 2024-28, Council is planning to include
Changing places facilities at more locations throughout the municipality however one
is not planned for Brighton Beach Pavilion due to site constraints. The funding
announcement for the Trevor Barker Oval is understood to be a Sandringham Football
Club project and is not a project delivered by Council as part of its Sportsground
Pavilion Improvement Plan.
Bayside also has Changing Places facilities located at Well Street carpark, Thomas
Street Reserve and one soon to open at Beaumaris Arts Group facility, with three more
proposed or under consideration.
- Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve
- Dendy Park Athletics Pavilion
- Rickett’s Point

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
2. Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a further question related to changing place bathrooms at
Billilla House, and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
My question is in regard to the Billilla historic mansion toilet upgrade:
Part 1 Will a changing places bathroom be included in this project?
Part 2 If not, why does council consider the most vulnerable people in society to be unworthy
of a suitable public bathroom at our historic mansion?
Response from the Acting CEO
, A Changing Places facility is not planned as part of the upgrade at Billilla, in order to keep
within the existing building footprint.
There is a Changing Places facility within 850m of Billilla in the Well Street carpark located
behind Church Street.
Bayside also has Changing Places facilities located at Well Street carpark, Thomas Street
Reserve and one soon to open at Beaumaris Arts Group facility, with three more proposed or
under consideration.
- Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve
- Dendy Park Athletics Pavilion
- Rickett’s Point
3. Mr George Dakis submitted a question related to planning ResCode 55, and Mr Dakis
asked:
Question
Part 1 Is Bayside allowed to implement new planning overlays to counterbalance the new
2025 ResCode 55 and capture neighbourhood character into all applications?
Part 2 Or does the new ResCode 55 restrict councils creating overlays that override ResCode
55?
Response from the Acting CEO
In response to Part 1 of the Question, Bayside City Council has the ability to prepare a planning
scheme amendment tointroduce planning controls into the Bayside Planning Scheme which
could include Neighbourhood Character Overlay. This could enable character to be assessed
in conjunction with the new changes to ResCode.
Planning Practice Note 91, a Neighbourhood Character Overlay should not be used as a
‘blanket’ control across the municipality, and there is a specific criteria to be utilised when
applying such an Overlay.
As any amendment must be authorised and approved by the Minister for Planning it is
considered highly unlikely that such a proposal would gain support where it could be deemed
to be contrary to the Victorian Government objectives.
In response to Part 2 of the Question, the introduction of planning Overlays must be consistent
with the underlying planning controls. While there is no prohibition on Councils seeking to
introduce overlays that can be assessed in conjunction with the new changes to ResCode.
Notwithstandning this, it is unlikely any new Overlay would be supported if it were considered
to undermine or prevent the outcomes sought by the Victorian State Governements recent
planning reforms.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
4. Mr Graham Roberts submitted a question related to bus zones on Beach Road, and Mr
Roberts asked:
Question
In October 2024 Council removed 20 car parking spaces on Beach Road opposite the Brighton
Savoy and made them Bus Only Parking 24/7. No buses use this BUS ZONE in the afternoons,
evenings and early mornings and only spasmodically buses park there in the AM.
Can Council please change this back so cars can park as they used to instead of this Bus
Zone just being empty?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council is currently collecting data in traffic and parking movements in the vicinity of Dendy
Beach Pavilion and will use this data to refine parking controls.
In addition, the adopted Dendy Beach Visitor Management Plan also identifies Middle Brighton
Baths and Green Point car parks as future locations for bus parking subject to budget
allocation.
5. Ms Michelle Bentley submitted a question related to the Warm Water Pool, and Ms
Bentley asked:
Question
Bayside Council despite all the years of expense, planning, consultation, architectural design
and feasibility studies for the provision of a Warm Water Pool for the health and wellbeing of
the community, has recommended deferring its construction "indefinitely". What exactly do you
mean by "indefinitely"?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council is proposing to undertake an Aquatics Strategy that will determine the future of the
Sandringham Family Leisure Centre and the implications for the Warm Water Pool.
Council considered it is fiscally responsible to pause progress on the Warm Water Pool to
enable an aquatics strategy to be developed, identifying the best outcomes for meeting our
community’s aquatic needs into the future and ensuring we deliver value for residents and
ratepayers.
The Warm Water Pool is proposed to be deferred to enable this work to be completed. Further
consideration of the Warm Water Pool will be presented to Council at the conclusion of this
work.
6. Ms Bentley submitted a further question related to new built infrastructure, and Ms
Bentley asked:
Question
Since amalgamation 30 years ago, what new infrastructure has been built in Bayside for their
senior residents?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council has upgraded and dedicated multiple buildings to support seniors attending Mens
Sheds, University of the Third Age and Seniors Centres. Council also purchased and has
upgraded the former Freemasons building in Sandringham that is now dedicated to providing
socialisation activities for seniors.
Page No. 9

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
In addition to infrastructure Council has invested significantly in the expansion of aged care
services for residents in recent years when many other Councils have exited the service.
7. Ms Dineke McLean submitted a question related to new built infrastructure for senior
residents, and Ms McLean asked:
Question
Why has Council not built any new infrastructure for seniors, given their huge financial
contribution to this municipality?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council has upgraded and dedicated multiple buildings to support seniors attending Mens
Sheds, University of the Third Age and Seniors Centres. Council also purchased and has
upgraded the former Freemasons building in Sandringham that is now dedicated to providing
socialisation activities for seniors.
In addition to infrastructure Council has invested significantly in the expansion of aged care
service.
8. Ms Judy Tucker submitted a question related to the Warm Water Pool, and Ms Tucker
asked:
Question
BCC's Health and Wellbeing Plan 2021-2025 includes the building of a Warm Water Pool for
people with disabilities, frail seniors, and those recovering from accidents and surgeries.
Why are you recommending deferring, indefinitely, the building of the Warm Water Pool?
Response from the Acting CEO
While the warm water pool facility has strong community support, estimates to construct the
facility are now more than $27 million.
Council has proposed undertaking an aquatics strategy in 2025-26, which will consider both
the long term plans for the Sandringham Family Leisure Centre pool and the warm water pool
facility. Council does not have the funding available to complete both projects within the next
few years.
Council believes it is fiscally responsible to pause progress on the warm water pool to enable
an aquatics strategy to be developed, identifying the best outcomes for meeting our
community’s aquatic needs into the future and ensuring we deliver value for residents and
ratepayers.
The Warm Water Pool is proposed to be deferred to enable this work to be completed. Further
consideration of the Warm Water Pool will be presented to Council at the conclusion of this
work.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
9. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Council own source revenue, and
Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
As ASIC has advised that for some of the functions of Council such as Own source Revenue,
activities are conducted by the Corporation, Bayside City Corporation (ACN 163 566 621),
Part 1 When was the last annual meeting of the Municipal Corporation held?
Part 2 Have the minutes of the meeting containing the Annual Accounts been published?
Response from the Acting CEO
Bayside City Council is not a corporation as defined under the Corporations Act 2001 and
therefore is not subject to the financial reporting requirements under the Corporations Act
2001.
Bayside City Council is registered as a Local Government Entity, a body corporate under the
Local Government Act 2020 and its statutory reporting obligations which have been met are in
accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2020.
Council’s Annual Accounts are certified by Council at the September Council meeting each
year and minutes of that meeting published on Council’s website shortly after.
10. Mr Kevin Tasker submitted a question related to the Southern Wetlands, and Mr
Tasker asked:
Question
Can the Council provide evidence that they have conducted reasonable investigations, a
proper informative public engagement on natural design materials and appropriate MUSIC
modelling with Melbourne Water into whether the Southern Wetlands can be constructed as
an ephemeral wetland without the use of a hydrocarbons in a geotextile liner?
Response from the Acting CEO
Council and its appointed constructed wetlands designer have undertaken extensive MUSIC
modelling to inform the design of the wetland, and Melbourne Water has undertaken their own
independent TuFlow modelling to confirm that the design does not compromise flood
mitigation.
Due to the constraints of the site, a liner is required to achieve the full masterplan objectives.
Council’s Community and Stakeholder Engagement Policy 2021 acknowledges Community
Engagement data is one of many data sources to inform Council’s decision making.
The Elsternwick Park Masterplan document was adopted following extensive community
consultation in 2020, and the wetlands design closely aligns with Masterplan objectives.
Officers have also met with YWNA representatives numerous times throughout the design
process, sharing all construction drawings and other material. Council also worked closely with
YWNA on the plant selection process for the 200,000+ plants forming part of the wetland
design.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 29 April 2025
11. Mr Kevin Tasker submitted a further question related to the Southern Wetlands, and Mr
Tasker asked:
Question
Can the Council provide the documented evidence that legally required processes have been
applied and recorded to the Southern Wetlands design use of a Hydrocarbon based Geotextial
that is completely contrary to the environmental and ephemeral intent of the Master Plan.
And most importantly the Public mandate and will as provided to the Council, Officers and
Councillors through a democratic process. That the Council can document that Council
Officers have acted in accordance with legally required processes and with public in mind.
Response from the Acting CEO
Council’s wetland design complies with the Melbourne Water Constructed Wetland Guidelines
and has been approved by Melbourne Water. Council has met with YWNA numerous times to
discuss the design and how a geosynthetic clay liner is a non-negotiable given the site context
and masterplan objectives.
Council undertook extensive community engagement, including deliberative practices, through
the development of the Elsternwick Park Masterplan 2020. Council’s Stakeholder Engagement
Policy 2021 acknowledges that as a project progresses towards detailed design and delivery,
the flexibility in time available and decisions that are ‘negotiable’ and can be influenced
typically reduces.
In cases such as this, where the wetlands project is in ‘delivery’, broad engagement is typically
not undertaken as significant decisions have either already been made, or are informed by
technical, legislative and financial requirements (etc) and the ability to influence is limited.
In addition to monthly meetings with representatives from the YWNA Executive Committee,
Officers have met regularly with YWNA specifically regarding the wetlands design since
December 2024. This included extensive involvement in plant selection, input into the Fauna
Management Plan for construction and several other matters that have informed both the
design and operation of the wetland.
12. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question related to sporting infrastructure, and Mr
Howard asked:
Question
Part 1 How much has Council spent designing and constructing sporting infrastructure,
including ovals, pavilions, and centres for non-field sports such basketball and
netball, during the previous two terms of Council (from 2016)?
Part 2 How much has Council spent in the same timeframe, maintaining sports ovals?
Response from the Acting CEO
The information requested will take time to collate and will require a separate response to be
provided in writing to you in due course.
The 15 minutes allocated for public question time elapsed at this time of the meeting. A
further 3 questions were received from Mr Kevin Howard, and Ms Aiimee Burslem.
All submitters of the public questions received will receive a written response to their
questions.
