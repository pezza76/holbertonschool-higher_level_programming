waterways and respects that their connection and spiritual identity is maintained

3. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question regarding pet ownership and compliance in Bayside,
and Mr Howard asked:
Question
Successive Domestic Animal Management Plans adopted by Council have included priorities
and activities to promote and encourage responsible pet ownership and compliance with
legislation.
Part 1. In light of the awful incident last month when a dog was killed by another dog
at Elsternwick Park South, would Council please explain what it has done in
recent years to educate dog owners about responsible dog ownership.
Part 2. What activities has Council undertaken to promote responsible dog ownership
specifically by people who are NOT Bayside residents, but use visit Bayside
parks and reserves with their dogs?
Response from the CEO
Part 1
Council’s approach to educating dog owners about responsible dog ownership has
comprised a range of activities including:
• promotion and access to information through our website, publications, social media,
new and renewed dog registrations, pop-up stands and Pets Day Out
• signage at key open space areas, which is set to be upgraded in the 2023–24
financial year
• liaison with key interest groups such as sports clubs and the Bayside Dog Alliance
• regular proactive and targeted patrols of open space by Local Laws Officers with
increased patrols during daylight savings
• investigating alleged breaches and taking enforcement action.
Part 2
The above activities seek to promote responsible dog ownership to both residents and
visitors.
Responsible dog ownership is not unique to Bayside and all dog owners within the State
must ensure they manage their pet in line with the requirements of the Domestic Animals Act
1994.

Question
In the last few years numerous people and dogs have been attacked by other dogs in
Elsternwick Park South. In several cases I know of personally that have been reported to
Council, no action could be taken because the dogs were presumed to be unregistered and
the owners could not be traced.
Question Part 1. In the last 12 months, how many patrols have Local Law Officers
conducted in Elsternwick Park South?
Question Part 2. In the last 12 months how many unregistered dogs have been
detected in Elsternwick Park South?
Response from the CEO

Local law officers patrol of Elsternwick Park South proactively at least once a week, with
increased patrols during daylight savings.
Part 2
Data on the specific number of unregistered dogs detected in Elsternwick Park South over
