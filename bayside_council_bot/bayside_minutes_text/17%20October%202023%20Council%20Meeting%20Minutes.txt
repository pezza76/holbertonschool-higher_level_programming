6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question related to Council’s Disability Action Plan, and Mr Naylor
asked:
Question
a) Why does council's disability action plan lack accountability with no council employee
owner nominated for each line item?
b) Why does council's disability action plan lack accountability with no clear delivery
date for each line item?
Response from the CEO
a) Each action within the Disability Action Plan has a lead staff member and
partners allocated. The public version of the Disability Action Plan, as
published on Council’s website, includes the role title of the staff who are
designated as the lead and partners responsible for each action.
b) The annual action plan of the Disability Action Plan includes the timeline for
completion of actions. Many actions are recurrent each year, whereas others
are a one-off action that might be completed either within a set year, or over
several years. Timelines generally includes the month and year for
completion.

what if any funds or in-kind works would council supply to assist VicRoads or any other

introduction of improved cycling infrastructure on South Road through both municipalities.
