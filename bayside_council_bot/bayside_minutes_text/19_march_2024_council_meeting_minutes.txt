6. Public Question Time
1. Mrs Victoria Smtih
Mrs Victoria Smith submitted a question related to the North Brighton Childrens Centre, and
Mrs Smith asked:
Question
What is proposed for the space which was used as Brighton Playroom at the North Brighton
Childrens Centre? Will another occasional care facility be provided in this space?
Response from the CEO
Plans for future utilisation of the space previously used by Brighton Playroom at the North
Brighton Children’s Centre are currently being considered, including conversations with
interested community groups and members. This is being undertaken within the broader
context of the Early Years Infrastructure Plan which is currently in review.
2. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a question regarding Council’s 2021–22 accounting
statement, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
I ask a question in relation to an $18.05 million payment to the Victorian School Building
Authority.
(a) As Council, in Note 5.2(b) of its 2021-22 accounting statement, recorded that the pre-
payment was to be recorded as a right-of-use asset, when complete, why was the asset not
delivered to Council as contracted?
AND
(b) As the asset has now been delivered to a newly formed entity named the Bayside and
District Netball Association, has Council demanded the return of the pre-payment?
Response from the CEO
a. The project was delivered in accordance with the Joint Use Agreement between the
Minister for Education, Sandringham College, and Bayside City Council.
b. Bayside District Netball Association continue to operate under the same ABN, just
registering a new business name that better reflects the community it serves.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 March 2024
3. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question. The question is regarding enforcement of
Council’s Local Law, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
I ask a question about Council officers' enforcement of Local Law No 2. for claimed
infringements related to events which take place on private land.
(a) As section 86 of the Local Government Act 2020, and s124 of the Local Government Act
1989 (now revoked) both state that a Local Law must be considered to be a by-law (and not
enforceable by the Supreme Court), why do Council staff continue to issue infringement
notices?
AND
(b) Will Councillors now seek to identify those residents and ratepayers improperly treated by
false enforcement procedures, served during the past four years of their Council
stewardship, and ensure that adequate reparation and compensation is paid.?
Response from the CEO
Council’s Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021 (the Local Law) is the current local law
since 1 July 2021; made under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1989.
A local law made under the Local Government Act 1989 continues in force and may be
amended or revoked by a local law made under the new Act.
Section 86 of the Local Government Act 2020 carries over the provisions from section 124 of
the Local Government Act 1989, setting out that a person can dispute the validity of a Local
Law at the Supreme Court.
Both Acts enable infringements to be issued for alleged offences against local laws as an
alternative to prosecution. Infringements issued for alleged offences of the Local Law are
legally enforceable.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 March 2024
8. Mr Paul Langley
Mr Paul Langley submitted a question regarding the Bayside Netball Centre, and Mr Langley
asked:
Question
My question is about the Bayside Netball Centre and the Council's resolution of the meeting
of 25 February 2021.
(a) As the resolution of 25 February 2021 was not complied with by Council staff,
particularly in relation to item 8, which authorised the CEO to sign a Community Joint
Use Agreement, and item 10, to provide the Sandringham and District Netball
Association (now defunct) with a license for community use, why was the venture
allowed to proceed to completion in the second half of 2023?
(b) Why has the CEO entered into a tripartite agreement with the school and the Bayside
and District Netball Association without any resolution from Council?
Response from the CEO
a. Consistent with Council’s decision at its 25 February 2021 Special Meeting, the Chief
Executive Officer has signed a Community Joint Use Agreement on behalf of Council
in relation to the Bayside Community Sports Centre at Holloway Road with the
Minister for Education, Sandringham College and Bayside City Council. The question
is somewhat misleading in that it indicates the Sandringham and District Netball
Association is ‘defunct’. That is not correct. In reality the entity name has changed to
better representative that it serves of Bayside. The change in entity name no bearing
on the project delivery or Council’s decision to enter into an agreement in relation to
the site.
b. The agreements entered into in relation to the Bayside Community Sports Centre at
Holloway Road are consistent with Council’s adopted position. A change of business
name for the same entity does not require a report to Council.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 March 2024
9. Mr Robert Telling
Mr Robert Telling submitted a question regarding Council’s Reconciliation Action Plan
Advisory Group and Mr Telling asked:
Question
My question relates specifically to the Charter relating to the Reconciliation Action Plan
(RAP) Advisory Committee. 2 of the 9 stated objectives of The RAP Advisory Group’s are the
following items:
• assist in planning community engagement to achieve reconciliation goals and outcomes.
• support Council to engage with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and
community members, to achieve reconciliation goals and outcomes.
A) Can Council please clarify exactly what are these stated, “reconciliation goals and
outcomes”?
B) Could Council outline how these "reconciliation goals and outcomes" would be
measured?
Response from the CEO
A. Council’s Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) is based on Reconciliation
Australia’s RAP Program. This aims to advance the five dimensions of reconciliation
– race relations, equality and equity, institutional integrity, unity, and historical
acceptance.
Council’s Innovate RAP focuses on four key goals in order to progress these
dimensions of reconciliation in Bayside. The key goals focus on relationships,
respect, opportunities, and governance.
The Bayside Reconciliation Action Plan is published on the Council website.
B. The four goals of the RAP are measured through the implementation of deliverable
actions that are tracked quarterly against progress indicators, as well as an
independent bi-annual assessment process, conducted by Reconciliation Australia.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 March 2024
10. Ms Lindsey Joffe
Ms Lindsey Joffe submitted a question regarding Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve and Ms
Joffe asked:
Question
A) Why does the YW Nature Reserve need to be re-zoned if the current zoning (PPRZ)
together the Masterplan would adequately enable the protection and conservation of
those areas of significance that are outlined in the Masterplan?
B) On what basis is the re-zoning being sought by the Council given that the Masterplan
which proposes to partially or completely exclude the public from certain areas of the
YW Nature Reserve is inconsistent with both the purpose for which this Crown Land
is permanently reserved and the Council’s role as committee of management to
manage, improve, maintain and control the reserve for the purposes for which it is
reserved?
Response from the CEO
A) The rezoning of Yalukit Wilam Nature Reserve from Public Park and Recreation Zone
to Public Conservation Resource Zone was identified as an action in the adopted
Bayside Urban Forest Strategy 2022–40.
B) Rezoning the Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve from Public Park and Recreation Zone
to Public Conservation and Resource zone does not propose any changes to public
access and use.
11. Mr Angus Morrison
Mr Angus Morrison submitted a question regarding Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve and Mr
Morrison asked:
Question
What are the specific changes to the public access and use including on-leash dog-walking
at Yalukit William Reserve and the Highett Grassy Woodland as a result of the proposed
rezoning, as the rezoning must serve a purpose with associated actions and implications?
Response from the CEO
Rezoning the Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve from Public Park and Recreation Zone to Public
Conservation and Resource zone does not propose any changes to public access and use of
the reserve.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 19 March 2024
12. Mr Angus Morrison
Mr Angus Morrison submitted a further question. The question is regarding a
recommendation of Council’s Reconciliation Action Plan Advisory Group and Mr Morrison
asked:
Question
Where does the Council's procurement process and policy stand on the recommendation of
the RAP Advisory Group to work with First Nations suppliers as soon as possible, actively
discriminating in favour of First Nations suppliers for the Yalukit William Reserve
Response from the CEO
The Reconciliation Action Plan Advisory Group encouraged Council to work with First
Nations suppliers as early as possible through the procurement process, where appropriate.
Council’s current Procurement Policy 2021–25 states that:
• Council will seek to advance economic, environmental and social objectives to benefit
the community: directly, by purchasing from for-social benefit entities.
• At its discretion, Council may apply a preference of up to 10% in the evaluation of
proposals that:
i. are from Social Enterprises or include Social Enterprises in their supply chain;
and/or
ii. are from Indigenous Suppliers or include Indigenous Suppliers in their supply
chain.
• Council seeks to address disadvantage by encouraging diversity, acceptance,
fairness, compassion, inclusiveness and access for people of all abilities in its
purchasing by seeking to:
-create new jobs and opportunities for people who may be struggling to find work
-target cohorts that may be experiencing economic exclusion
-reinvigorate depressed or marginalised communities
-improve equity of access to opportunities.
The Mayor noted that given the maximum of 15 minutes allocated for Public Question Time
had been reached, the remaining 11 questions (from Ms Joanne Byrant, Mr David Orford, Mr
Delano Pikart, Mrs Lotte Pikart, Mr Kevin Howard, Mr Chris Sutton, Mr Andrew Hockley, and
Mr Dean Hurlston) that were not answered in the allotted time will be responded to in writing;
however, in accordance with Governance Rules, will not appear in the Minutes.
