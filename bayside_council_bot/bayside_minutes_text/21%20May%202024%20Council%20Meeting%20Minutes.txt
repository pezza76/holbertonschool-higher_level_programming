6. Public Question Time
1. Miss Marissa Williams
Miss Marissa Williams submitted a question related to lighting at Wishart Reserve, and Miss
Williams asked:
Question
Why are there no lights at wishart dog park?
Couldn’t we have lights on a timer or energy efficient solar lights (hence not disturbing
neighbours) its so dark and feels dangerous?
Response from the CEO
Lighting was not included within the scope of works for the improvements to Wishart Reserve
and feedback from adjoining residents was not supportive of the introduction of lighting within
the reserve. The budget was insufficient to accommodate any significant lighting upgrades
and was not raised as a significant theme during community engagement.
2. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a question related to Federal Government
funding for Council projects and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
Our community lost $100 million of local funding in the 2022 Federal Budget, should that
funding be secured from the Federal government for the same projects would the Council
accept the funding?
Response from the CEO
Council’s advocacy priorities for the next Federal election are currently being refined and will
be pursued with all political parties over the coming months.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 May 2024
3. Mrs Courtney De Cesare (on behalf of The Highett Progress Association)
Mrs Courtney De Cesare (on behalf of The Highett Progress Association) submitted a
question related to height regulations proposed for the Suburban Rail Loop, and Mrs De
Cesare asked:
Question
The Highett Progress Association and the greater Highett community have grave concerns
about the new height regulations proposed by the Suburban Rail Loop Authority, specifically
increased heights up to 18 stories at the former CSIRO site (now The Highett Commons)
across its 15 towers.
1: Does Bayside City Council possess relevant data and analysis which would prove that
surrounding infrastructure cannot support an increase of such magnitude on this specific
site?
2: How does the Council intend to respond to the SRLA regarding this site and what
measures will be taken to protect the new and existing community’s liveability and
Neighbourhood Character, including The Highett Grassy Woodlands which could be
decimated by such extreme height and density.
Response from the CEO
1. The release of the information by the SRLA has proposed significant changes to the
land use and built form outcomes in the Highett and Pennydale areas. Council has
not undertaken any analysis to understand the capacity or limitations our
infrastructure will have on growth.
It is noted that the proposed increases in density would require significant investment
and upgrade of existing assets including roads, stormwater drainage, open space,
and community facilities.
2. A report will be presented to the July 2024 Council Meeting in response to the
recently published Suburban Rail Loop Key Emerging Directions. This report will
provide a recommendation for Council to consider as its position on the published
plans.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 May 2024
4. Mrs Angela Burr (on behalf of the Highett Progress Association)
Mrs Angela Burr submitted a question related to traffic and pedestrian safety in Highett, and
Mrs Burr asked:
Question
With the recent release of Councils 2024/25 budget, The Highett Progress Association is
alarmed that no allocation has been made to assess and update Highett’s traffic and
pedestrian safety crisis amidst the extreme development and growth expected in the next
financial year and beyond. Our members would like to ask:
1: How much incremental income has Council already received to date in rates from the
Sunkin Highett Commons (former CSIRO) development and what is expected in 2024/25?
2: Even if the data to answer question 1 is considered confidential, whether it is reasonable
that a portion of that increment be invested to understand the immediate and long term
impact on the surrounding community and deploy mitigating actions where feasible?
Response from the CEO
1. Council has received a total of $394,200 to date in rates in association with the
property at 37 Graham Street, Highett. It is expected that rates in 2024–25 will be
approximately $82,000.
2. The approval of the Highett Common development included traffic modelling which
has been approved as an acceptable response to managing traffic generated by that
site. The response will also support the wider traffic network.
As part of the current SRLA work, when the data becomes available, Council will be
undertaking its own independent assessment of the traffic analysis to understand
what additional network improvements will be required.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 May 2024
5. Mrs Ruth Sabella
Mrs Ruth Sabella submitted a question related to traffic surrounding the former CSIRO site in
Highett, and Mrs Sabella asked:
Question
In March 2022 Council planners approved the Stage 1 Development Plan of The Highett
Commons (Former CSIRO site) which included a newly created Exit Road onto Middleton
Street, which in doing so created the fastest and shortest exit for the entire site (up to 4,000
daily car movements) to dangerously rat-run directly into the quiet Neighbourhood
Residential Zone.
1. The Donald Street Residents Group would like to know, If an updated traffic
assessment was required before such an impactful approval, why were Middleton
Street and Graham Rd confirmed by Council planners to be the ONLY roads recently
assessed and no reporting and analysis done independently on the several
surrounding streets and already dangerous and known intersections where future
traffic will now exceed theoretical capabilities?
2. What measures will Council now take to reduce and slow traffic that funnels from the
enormous and growing Highett Commons site directly into the Neighbourhood
Residential Zone?
Response from the CEO
1. The Development Plan approval for 37 Graham Road, Highett was approved by
Council at its October 2021 Council Meeting and included a requirement for a revised
Traffic Impact Assessment and the provision of one-way access onto Middleton
Street in lieu of the originally proposed two-way access.
Updated Traffic Modelling for the one-way exit arrangement was deemed to be the
most appropriate design outcome. This was subsequently agreed to and approved by
the relevant authorities including the Department for Transport (now Department of
Transport and Planning) and the Responsible Authority.
2. Any measures required to manage traffic in the area to the west of the 37 Graham
Road, Highett site are a responsibility of Council as the Road Management Authority
and would be considered under the provisions of Council’s Local Area Traffic
Management Policy 2023.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 May 2024
6. Mr Jim Griffin
Mr Jim Griffin submitted a question related to a tree removal and traffic arrangements at the
former CSIRO site in Highett, and Mr Griffin asked:
Question
1. What if any was the monetary compensation Council received from Sunkin to remove
the large, healthy and significant Red Flowering Gum tree from Middleton Street in
January 2024 in order to build a new Exit Road from the Highett Commons?
2. Why wasn’t realignment of the road or an Entrance Only configuration mandated by
council both to protect this tree and the Neighbourhood Residential Zone from
extreme volumes of Exit traffic?
Response from the CEO
1. As part of this application, a referral was made to Council’s Open Space team who
provided a tree amenity valuation for the tree to the value of $11,616.38 which was
paid by the applicant before a permit was granted.
2. Multiple traffic arrangements were explored as part of the assessment of the
Development Plan approval process. As part of the approval of the Development Plan
by Council at its October 2021 Council Meeting, a requirement for a revised Traffic
Impact Assessment and the provision of one-way access onto Middleton Street in lieu
of the originally proposed two-way access was sought.
Updated Traffic Modelling for the one-way exit arrangement was deemed to be the
most appropriate design outcome. This was subsequently agreed to and approved by
the relevant authorities including the Department for Transport.
7. Mr David Frauman
Mr David Frauman submitted a question related to Federal funding for the Bayside
community, and Mr Frauman asked:
Question
We lost $100m of local funding when Zoe Daniel voted for Federal Labor’s 2022 Budget,
given it has now been revealed she also voted for $2 billion in new coal rebates, has Council
written to these companies seeking $100 million of funding for our community”?
Response from the CEO
Council has not and does not intend to write to these companies to seek funding.

council either committed or spent on the relocation to the college.
(2) What extra funds has council has spent, expecting or planning to spend this financial

2) Council has also spent $569,423 towards traffic management plan implementation for
the site. There is an additional $145,000 allocated to undertake minor additional works
to the facility. An additional $15,000 will be spent on a review of traffic conditions.
11. Mrs Alysia Regan
Mrs Alysia Regan submitted a question related to the Suburban Rail Loop, and Mrs Regan
asked:
Question
Bayside has been working with the Suburban Rail Loop Authority to advocate for positive
outcomes within Bayside specifically Highett and Hampton East.
At the most recent SRL meeting the community were advised it will be another two years
before confirmation of heights and set the rules around setbacks and actual planning rules.
What does this current advocacy look like and could the community please be given
examples?
Response from the CEO
Council officers have been responding formally to the SRLA as part of all community
consultation periods including:
1. the Suburban Rail Loop East Inquiry and Advisory Committee in response to the
EES, in February 2022
2. the SRL Precinct Discussion Paper, released in September 2023
3. the SRL Draft Precinct Vision for Cheltenham SRL East, released in December 2023.
More recently, the SRLA is undertaking community consultation on the Key Emerging
Directions for the SRL Cheltenham Precinct which will conclude at the end of June. Council
officers are currently preparing a formal submission which is proposed to be presented to the
July 2024 Council Meeting for formal endorsement.
Council’s advocacy to date has centred around building heights and density, connectivity and
traffic impacts, and open space in line with feedback received from the community.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 May 2024
12. Mr Leigh Funston
Mr Leigh Funston submitted a question related to offshore wind proposals, and Mr Funston
asked:
Question
Would any offshore wind proposal for Port Philip Bay be given a fair hearing by Bayside City
Council as part of its path to net zero and the expansion of renewables, or be rejected
outright?
Response from the CEO
Any offshore wind proposals for Port Phillip Bay would fall outside of our municipal
jurisdiction and would likely require a Public Environment Report or Environmental Impact
Statement under the Federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
1999.
The remaining 7 questions received from Mr Leigh Funston, Mr George Reynolds, Mr Paul
Langley and Mr Fraser Gibson were not read at the meeting out as the 15 minutes allowable
for public question time had expired. These questions (and those that were read out) will be
responded to in writing

findings concluding that public transport provisioning had increased over a 19-year
period though this was largely achieved through measures such as removal of seats and
alterations to the rolling stock rather than an increase in carriage capacity. The Forum
continues to seek input form councils that have concerns about gaps in transport
services particularly for older community members or those with disabilities. Darebin,
Hobsons Bay and Hume councils also provide monthly updates.
