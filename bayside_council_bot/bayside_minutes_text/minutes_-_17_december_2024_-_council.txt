6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Robert Telling submitted a question related to road flooding, and Mr Telling
asked:
Question
In recent times there has been road -flooding on a number of Bayside roads. Examples have
been Beach Road adjacent to the Trevor Barker Oval (after less than 30mm of rain) & regularly
on Beach Road near Ricketts Point Café. Can you advise:
Part 1 how many roadside drain sumps there are (approx.) in Bayside, that are the
responsibility of Bayside Council.
Part 2 how many times per year these roadside drain sumps are inspected and if necessary
cleaned
Response from the CEO
1. Council is responsible for 15,932 drainage pits in Bayside of which 7,388 collect
stormwater run-off from the road surface.
2. At a minimum, Council drainage assets are proactively inspected once every 3 years,
or reactively as requested. Where there are known issues, pits get cleaned and
weeds are removed more regularly. In specific ‘hotspot’ locations, contractors clear
the pipe and pits leading up to known high-rain events.
Council is generally not responsible for drainage pits that collect run-off from main roads such
as Beach Road. These are the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Planning.
2. Mr Robert Hay submitted a question related to the Wangara Road Masterplan, and
Mr Hay asked:
Question
Now that the masterplan has been developed, could council please present a timeline for both
funding and construction of the new open space.
Response from the CEO
Council has scheduled remediation works to take place throughout 2024–25. A new car park
will be constructed in 2025–26 with budget foreshadowed in 2025–26 to undertake the detailed
design of the other elements of the Masterplan from 2025–26.
Council has allocated $2.4 million to the implementation of the Wangara Road Masterplan.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 December 2024
3. Mr Graham Roberts submitted a question related to parking, and Mr Roberts asked:
Question
On 28th October I visited Council and requested to speak with an appropriate Council member
about my query on the change of traffic signage on The Esplanade Brighton Beach.
Part 1 How did Council arrive at allowing 75M for Bus Parking only the equivalent of 5 buses
Part 2 And not withstanding this is Council monitoring the use of this newly designated bus
parking only area v car spaces to ensure this is warranted. Why is council removing
car spots in this area when more residents are moving into Bayside with all the new
development and population increases?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council officers have reviewed several options to address the significant challenge of
bus parking in the precinct. Demand for bus parking can reach 8 to 10 buses during
peak times and so the space on the Esplanade combined with overflow parking at
Green Point was designated.
Part 2 A sensor is being used to monitor the utilisation of the temporary bus parking area and
this data will inform future adjustments to the strategy. We understand that parking
availability is a key challenge, and balancing the needs of buses and cars is complex.
However, bus parking is crucial for managing large visitor numbers and minimising
congestion in residential streets.
4. Mr Jenson Galvin submitted a question related to crime in Bayside, and Mr Galvin
asked:
Question
Considering the rising rate of crime in Bayside, paying particular attention to the recent incident
related to the Bayside Carols in the Park, what firm actions are councillors (particularly those
who campaigned on an issue of "improving public safety by addressing rising crime rates",
taking to address these continuous crimes being undertaken in our council?
Response from the CEO
Council and Victoria police meet fortnightly to discuss concerns and emerging themes and
identify pro-active steps to address these. In addition, Council facilitates a six-weekly
Community Safety Committee that includes Victoria Police, Bayside Neighbourhood Watch
and other organisations with a focus on working together to improve community safety.
The Mayor and Councillors meet with Senior Victoria Police officers annually to understand
crime rates in Bayside and to identify shared opportunities to work together. A meeting
between Councillors and Victoria Police is scheduled to occur in the first half of 2025.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 December 2024
5. Mr Jenson Galvin submitted a further question related to Carols in the Park publicity,
and Mr Galvin asked:
Question
Noting the publicity provided to Optus at the recent Carols in the Park, what is the value of
financial or in-kind sponsorship provided to Bayside City Council by Optus?
Response from the CEO
An $8,000 contribution was provided by Optus to Council’s appointed contractor to sponsor
the 2024 Christmas Carols in the Park event.
6. Ms Kimberley Tolley submitted a question related to Christmas decorations in
Highett, and Ms Tolley asked:
Question
Highett Road has historically been allocated minimal Christmas decorations and this year has
seen a further reduction with just two Christmas trees in Highett Village and the noticeable
removal of hanging decorations above Only About Children on Highett Road.
Part 1 Can Council please explain the decision process to reduce decorations in Highett when
the likes of Hampton Street has increased to over 25 Christmas trees?
Part 2 Will council commit to providing a more balanced allocation of decorations to Highett
in the following years?
Response from the CEO
Council’s criteria for the placement of decorations are that they are high impact and are highly
visible to pedestrians and vehicular traffic to attract visitation and expenditure into the local
economy.
15 metres of bright red and white Christmas Banners have been placed on fence railings close
to Highett Station to replace decorations that were in these locations that were continually
vandalised, had safety concerns raised by the public or were considered to give low visual
impact.
Council will continue to work with Kingston City Council to deliver high impact decorations to
Highett.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 December 2024
7. Mrs Angela Burr submitted a question related to the Highett Bowls Club, and Mrs
Burr asked:
Question
The Highett Progress Association would like to understand the current status and future plans
for the Highett Bowls Club. Music for the Brain Foundation had planned events to prolong the
use of this space for the wider community which we understand Bayside Council cancelled.
Part 1 Why was Music and the Brain Foundation’s proposal rejected?
Part 2 When will future plans be discussed and exhibited?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Music for the Brain decided not to run its events at the site once Highett Bowls Club
committee made the decision to hand back its lease. Council offered Music for the Brain
access to the bowls club building or to find other Council venues which would allow
events to continue.
Part 2 No decision has been made as to the future use of the former Highett Bowls Club site.
Council is currently undertaking a detailed assessment of the site to review the
suitability of the site to be adapted for another purpose before a proposed approach is
presented to Council for consideration in 2025.
8. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Local Law infringements, and
Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
I ask a question on the prosecution of local law infringements in the Magistrates Court at
Moorabbin.
Part 1 As Council’s prosecutions continue to be successful despite local laws being unlawful,
will Council now require the CEO to advise the Court that local law infringements cannot
be proceeded with, and
Part 2 Will Council now require the CEO to advise the Court that the Informant, the Local Laws
and Parking Coordinator, has not been delegated authority to initiate any prosecution
Response from the CEO
Part 1 As previously advised, Council’s Local Law remains valid and enforceable, including
authorised officers’ ability to issue infringements.
Part 2 The Court Informant is authorised to institute proceedings for offences against the
Local Law.
Page No. 10

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 December 2024
9. Mr George Reynolds submitted a further question related to Local Law
infringements, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
We ask a question on the prosecution of local law infringements.
Part 1 As section 72(g) of the Local Government Act 2020 requires infringements to be
offences against a State law, or be imposed by any form of sub-delegation, before a
penalty can be imposed, will Council be directing the CEO to arrange for all such fees
and fines paid, for all Local Law infringements since 1st July 2021, being returned?
Part 2 Will all persons who suffered penalty during this period be advised accordingly.
Response from the CEO
Council’s Local Law remains valid and enforceable consistent with the provisions of Sections
71(6)&(7) of the Local Government Act 2020.
10. Mr Dean Hurlston submitted a question related to Council meeting catering costs
and Mr Hurlston asked:
Question
What is the approximate cost per public Council meeting for Councillor and Staff meals,
refreshments and beverages? (If applicable).
Response from the CEO
To date during 2024, Council has held 10 Council meetings, with the total cost of catering
being $8,585 for Councillors and Council officers. An average of $858.50 per meeting.
It should be noted that section 17 of Council’s Council Expenses Reimbursement Support and
Accountability Policy makes provision for Council to provide suitable meals for Councillors,
where Council meetings, functions or events are held at times that extend through normal
mealtimes (i.e. 6.30pm to 8.00pm).
The same applies for Council officers who are required to attend Council Meetings. Council’s
Enterprise Agreement requires Council officers to be paid a meal allowance where an
employee works more than two hours overtime during a minimum 10-hour duty.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 December 2024
11. Mr Douglas Klein submitted a question related to community facilities at Highett
Common, and Mr Klein asked:
Question
Relating to community facilities being developed at Highett Common on the former CSIRO
site, the Highett Progress Association asks:
Part 1 When will plans for the library, other facilities and public park be published so the
community is aware of what is being developed for their future amenity?
Part 2 Will the fit-out of both the internal facilities and the public park be fully funded by the
developer or will supplementary Council funds be required?
Response from the CEO
All endorsed Town Planning permits for Highett Common are available for viewing on the
Bayside City Council website. This includes ‘Building K’ which shows the community facility,
and the landscape plans for the park.
Under the terms of the agreement between Council and the developer, a budget has been set
for the delivery of the park and community facility by the developer. No additional funds are
required from Council for the delivery of the park; however, it is anticipated that additional funds
will be required for the fit-out of the community facility. The vast majority of the anticipated
costs, which will be determined once the project has been subject to a competitive tender
process, are costs which Council would have been liable for to operationalise the use of the
building
