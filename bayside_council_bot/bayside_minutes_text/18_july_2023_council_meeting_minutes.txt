The Mayor declared the Council Meeting open at 6.30pm and advised members of the public

1. Prayer
Cr del Porto read the prayer at the commencement of the meeting.
O God
Bless this City, Bayside,
Give us courage, strength and wisdom,
So that our deliberations,
May be for the good of all,
Amen
2. Acknowledgement of Country
Cr Martin read the acknowledgement of the original inhabitants of this land.
 Bayside City Council proudly acknowledges the Bunurong People of the Kulin
Nation as the Traditional Owners and Custodians of this land, and we pay our
respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging as well as any Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander community members with us today.
 Council acknowledges the Bunurong’s continuing relationship to the land and
waterways and respects that their connection and spiritual identity is maintained
through ancient ceremonies, songlines, dance, art and living culture.
 Council pays tribute to the invaluable contributions of the Bunurong and other
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Elders who have guided and continue to guide
the work we do.
The Mayor called for a minutes’ silence to acknowledge the recent passing of former Councillor
and Mayor of Bayside, Mr Graeme Disney OAM.
Graeme Disney OAM was elected as the first Mayor of Bayside City Council in 1997 and was
then re-elected to Council in 2000 and again was elected Mayor in the same year. Graeme
served the community of Bayside with great passion and knowledge during his six years on
Council.
As a local historian of Sandringham and Hampton, Graeme was the go-to person on the history
of Bayside and the former municipalities. Graeme was co-author to the very popular
publication titled “Bayside Reflections” which continues to be a very important resource across
the municipality.
As a lay preacher and community advocate, Graeme served his community with great dignity,
kindness and professionalism.

6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Kelvin Granger and Mr Dean Hurlston on behalf of ‘Council Watch’
Mr Kelvin Granger and Mr Dean Hurlston submitted a question related to the Council Budget,
and they asked:
Question
Can council please advise the dollar ($) amount of "cost shifting from State Government" that
they estimate was incurred in 2022/23 Financial Year?
Response from the CEO
The impact of cost shifting for 2022–23 is yet to be finalised and will be reported in the 2022–
23 Annual Report expected to be presented to Council at the October 2023 Council Meeting.
The amount of cost shifting in the 2021–22 year was 2.7million.
2. Mr Geoff Leigh
Mr Geoff Leigh submitted a question regarding Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve, and Mr Leigh
asked:
Question
With the development of the Yalukit William (formerly Elsternwick Park) Reserve
Council provide the original costing of the full project and the expected final costs to rate
payers as of this date.
This is to include the costs of plans, consultants, construction, landscaping and other
costings along with the completion date.
Response from the CEO
The development of the Masterplan for the Yalukit William Nature Reserve, including the
investigation work cost approximately $150,000.
The Masterplan is a high-level concept. The final costs for all works associated within the
Masterplan will be dependent on detailed designs and market costs at the time of
procurement.
Based on current market conditions, Council expects the cost of delivery of the Masterplan to
be approximately $22.35M.
Council has been successful in securing $6.5M in Federal grant funding to deliver part of the
Yalukit William Nature Reserve.
Council is currently applying for grant funding of $10M as a further contribution toward the
development of the Reserve, large part of which will be for the Gateway Building.
Council currently has $5.5M allocated in its long term financial plan to contribute towards the
redevelopment of Yalukit William Nature Reserve.
Due to the volume of works required, construction will be split over a number of years.
Establishment works are currently scheduled to be completed by June 2027.

3. Mr Geoff Leigh
Mr Geoff Leigh submitted a further question regarding Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve, and
Mr Leigh asked:
Question
In regarding the Yalukit William (formerly Elsternwick Park) Nature Reserve, Details of any
work done by council or consultants on the expected revenue in a 12 month period from the
public use and any commercial contracts that council will receive once the development of
the Reserve has been completed.
Response from the CEO
Should Council secure grant funding to create the Gateway Building, a feasibility assessment
will be undertaken to determine utilisation models for this space, including potential revenue
sources.
Council is currently developing the scope of the gateway building and will test this through a
design competition.
Commercial contracts for the operation of parts of the gateway building may be considered
as that building progresses.
4. Mr Leigh Funston
Mr Leigh Funston submitted a question regarding Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve, and Mr
Funston asked:
Question
My question concerns Bayside City Council's redevelopment of the golf course at Elsternwick
Park now called Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve.
Part 1. Given the new park is located on the northern boundary of Bayside City
Council's local government area, what funding did Council seek from
neighbouring councils (City of Port Phillip and City of Glen Eira) to develop the
new park?
Part 2. Given that the park's location means it will be used by large numbers of
residents in neighbouring council areas, what ongoing maintenance costs for
the new park have been sought by Council from City of Glen Eira and the City
of Port Phillip?
Response from the CEO
Council approached neighbouring local authorities to explore funding agreements due to the
Reserve’s strategic location.
The City of Port Phillip has agreed to contribute $350k towards the redevelopment of Yalukit
Willam Nature Reserve. The City of Glen Eira has not agreed to make any contribution.
No funding agreements have been entered into with regard to ongoing maintenance of the
Reserve.

5. Mr Paul Langley
Mr Paul Langley submitted a question regarding Council’s Budget, and Mr Langley asked:
Question
Council having recognised in its budget accounts that annual depreciation from 'right of use
assets' provides an annual cash flow to the Own Source Revenue stream-
(a) Is this cash stream being allocated to meet annual capital requirements such as the
contribution to the Victorian Schools Building Authority for the Netball Centre at Sandringham
Secondary College, the Beaumaris Soccer Club rooms and similar; and
(b) What proportion of the annual depreciation and amortisation provision is being allocated
to each investment?
Response from the CEO
Right of use assets are recorded in the balance sheet and amortised over the term of the
lease agreement in accordance with AASB16.
Council made an upfront cash contribution of $18.050 million to the Victorian School Building
Authority for the right to access the Netball Centre at the Sandringham College facility over
the term of the community agreement. The annual amortisation over the term of the
agreement is $902,500.
6. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a question regarding investments in the
community, and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
Can Bayside Council advise what funding it received in the 2023/24 Federal Budget for
investments in our community?
Response from the CEO
Commonwealth funding of $15.5 million has been committed for the Yalukit Willam Nature
Reserve redevelopment and will be received by Council over the coming years in
accordance with the funding agreements. No other funding was included in the 2023–24
Federal Budget for Council’s capital program.
During 2023–24, Council is expected to receive Commonwealth Funding of $14.5 million for
Aged and Disability Services delivered to the community including the expansion of the Aged
Care Package program as well as $3 million in untied Financial Assistance Grants.

The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a further question regarding electronic vehicle
use, and Mr Wilson asked:
Question
At the last Federal election $500,000 was committed by the then Federal Member for EV
charging stations in Bayside. Has any funding been provided to support Bayside Council’s
effort to support decarbonisation and EV uptake since the election of our current Federal
Member of Parliament?
Response from the CEO
Council has not received Federal funding for the delivery of electric vehicle charging
infrastructure.
8. Mr Derek Screen
Mr Derek Screen submitted a question regarding Item 10.4 on the Agenda – upgrade of Bay
and Graham Rd, Highett intersection, and Mr Screen asked:
Question
Can you please advise the expected timeline of when these new and highly anticipated and
needed traffic lights will be installed and operating and can and will Council advocate to have
this installation done as early as possible.
Response from the CEO
The Planning Permit for the site located at 37 Graham Road, Highett requires the owner to
upgrade and signalise the intersection of Bay Road and Graham Road, Highett prior to
occupation of their development.
It is understood that stage one of the development will be occupied by late 2024 or early
2025, meaning the intersection upgrade will need to be delivered prior to this time.
