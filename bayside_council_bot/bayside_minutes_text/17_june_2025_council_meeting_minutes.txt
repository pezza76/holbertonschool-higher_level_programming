Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 June 2025
6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Leigh Funston submitted a question related to the Suburban Rail Loop project,
and Mr Funston asked:
Question
Part 1 How much will Bayside City Council have to pay to establish and or expand the
necessary infrastructure to support the Victorian State Government's five Activity
Centres associated with the SRL?
Part 2 And will the costs of such Bayside City Council infrastructure be passed on to
ratepayers to pay? (eg costs of new drainage works, provision of additional open space,
additional council resources to meet larger population)
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council does not currently have an estimated cost on what infrastructure would be
required to support the Victorian Government’s Activity Centre Program or Suburban
Rail Loop Cheltenham Precinct Area at this point in time.
The Victorian Government is currently undertaking a review and reform of Infrastructure
Contributions Scheme in Victoria. Council has expressed serious concern that planning
for projects such as the Suburban Rail Loop and Activity Centres program are
proceeding ahead of this review being finalised and a clear understanding of how
development contributions will be collected to fund the significant infrastructure
required to support the anticipated increase in population.
Part 2 It is likely that the Infrastructure Contribution Levy will be applied to landowners wishing
to develop their land as a result of the State Government Infrastructure Contribution
reforms. This would result in a payment to either (or both) the State Government and
Local Government, depending on the type of infrastructure that is required in the
specific area. Existing ratepayers’ general rates may also be required to contribute
towards any infrastructure to support the anticipated growth, but this is not known at
this point in time.
2. Mr David Rothfield submitted a question related to the Climate Emergency Action
Plan, and Mr Rothfield asked:
Question
In 2019 Council adopted a climate emergency by unanimous vote and a climate emergency
action plan. What has happened to change that?
Response from the CEO
Council’s position on a climate emergency remains unchanged.
Bayside is committed to taking tangible environmental action as part of this budget including
planting 1400 trees per annum, implementing community sustainability education, and
enhancing our response to localised storm events by reviewing our drainage strategy and
coastal and marine management plan. We are also implementing the wetlands project at
Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve to improve biodiversity outcomes, residential amenity and
reducing nitrogen levels in stormwater going into the bay. We have embedded environmental
action within our plans and strategies and we will continue to work hard toward our climate
objectives.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 June 2025
3. Ms Kerryn Thorson (on behalf of Highett Progress Association) submitted a
question related to Highett Common, and Ms Thorson asked:
Question
Part 1 While welcoming new green open space at Highett Common, the HPA notes that recent
rainfall has identified significant drainage issues and ponding. What actions are the
Council taking to ensure this space is usable all year round and that drainage issues
are rectified prior to the formal opening to the public?
Part 2 If drainage issues are not rectified before formal handover/opening to the public, what
timeline for rectification will be placed on the Developer
Response from the CEO
Council has recorded the standing water issues and has formally notified the developer of this
defect. The developer is working with its Civil infrastructure contractor to investigate the subsoil
drainage installation and to rectify the issue to ensure it functions as designed.
Council has instructed the developer to maintain the temporary fencing on the site to protect
grass establishment while the subsoil drainage rectification works are undertaken. Council is
working with the developer to understand the subsoil drainage issues and once we are aware
of the issue, will be in a position to confirm to the community how long the rectification process
will take.
4. Ms Kerryn Thorson (on behalf of Highett Progress Association) submitted a
further question related to Highett Common, and Ms Thorson asked:
Question
Part 1 Can Council please provide us and our members an update regarding its investigations
into the widening of the Highett Common Middleton Street exit?
Part 2 What actions are the Council taking to ensure that roadway remains exit only through
to the Neighbourhood residential zone.
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council has advised the developer of the Highett Common that the proposed widening
of the access to Middleton Street, and two-way traffic flow is not in accordance with the
approved Development Plan. Should the developer wish to pursue this then a Planning
Application will be required and would need to go through a full planning process.
Part 2 Council will manage this issue, which we are currently dealing with via a Planning
Permit process.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 June 2025
5. Mr Mark Clair submitted a question related to the Climate Emergency declaration,
and Mr Clair asked:
Question
Five years ago, the Council declared a Climate Emergency. A five-year plan was developed.
Can you please explain why there has been almost no provision made for climate related
activities in the forthcoming budget, despite the Climate Emergency declaration?
Response from the CEO
Climate and environmental action have been embedded within the Council plan and strategies
over the life of the Climate Emergency Action Plan, and we will continue to work hard toward
our climate objectives. A number of key initiatives will be implemented in 2025–26 year,
including tree planting, integrated water management, flood modelling, drainage strategy and
community education.
6. Ms Susan Thompson submitted a question related to drainage impacted by climate
change, and Ms Thompson asked:
Question
How will the Bayside City Council plan for drainage and other important requirements impacted
by climate change if it hasn't allocated money for a comprehensive climate risk assessment in
the current budget?
Response from the CEO
Bayside is currently collaborating with Melbourne Water on a two-year Flood Mapping Project
which integrates the high-emissions RCP8.5 global warming scenario. This modelling will
inform Council’s next iteration of its drainage strategy which is due early in 2026. Bayside
continues to invest in drainage infrastructure upgrades including over $5.1M on the
improvements to Third Street and Head St. Our four-year capital program currently includes
$14M allocated for major drainage infrastructure to support the implementation of the drainage
strategy. Our other asset classes include climate change responses as a service level factor
and it continues to be a key consideration in planning, designing and maintaining assets.
7. Ms Susan Thompson submitted a question related to Urban Forest Program, and
Ms Thompson asked:
Question
How will the Council meet its goal of increasing tree canopy cover to 30% by 2040, including
in identified hotspots, if the Urban Forest Program is not funded for the next 4 years?
Response from the CEO
If the budget allocated to the Urban Forest Strategy is removed as part of the finalisation of
2025–26 Council Budget, this will mean that some aspects of the Urban Forest Strategy will
be discontinued, such as the accelerated tree planting on Council-owned land.
Council will however still be planting approximately 1400 trees per annum with a key
performance indicator of 90% survival rate.
Actions from the Urban Forest Strategy that do not require funding, such as advocacy, can
continue and Council will still be able to advocate for greener outcomes across the municipality.
The Strategy remains an endorsed Council document.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 June 2025
8. Mr David Dawson submitted a question related to Bayside’s art collection, and Mr
Dawson asked:
Question
Part 1 What is the estimated value, or valuation for insurance purposes, of Bayside City
Council's art collection?
Part 2: What is the total approximate annual cost of maintaining the art collection, including
any related costs, such as staff costs, storage, movement, security and insurance?
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The Bayside Art & Heritage Collection is comprised of the following four categories:
Visual Arts Collection; Cultural Heritage Collection (which includes Memorials and
Monuments located within Bayside); Local Government Collection and the Public Art
Collection.
The total insurance value across these four categories is $5,996,160.
Part 2 The approximate annual cost of maintenance of the Bayside Arts & Heritage Collection
is $80,000 which is approximately 1.3% of its value.
9. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question related to Dendy Life Saving Club, and Mr
Howard asked:
Question
Part 1. Can you please confirm whether car parking spaces were removed from the Keith Court
car park as part of the LSC redevelopment?
Part 2. Has any additional car parking been provided within the Life Saving Club precinct to
accommodate the increased numbers of visitors to the precinct, due to the commercial
cafe tenancy that was created as part of the redevelopment
Response from the CEO
Part 1 The Keith Court car park currently provides 53 standard car parking bays and two
accessible car parking bays. The previous layout had provision for 58 bays in total.
Part 2 There has not been any additional parking created off-street; however, Council is
continuing to review and update on-street parking restrictions to manage visitor
demands within the area.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 17 June 2025
10. Mr Kevin Howard submitted a further question related to operational efficiency, and
Mr Howard asked:
Question
My question relates to Council's operational efficiency gains.
Part 1 What cost savings per year does Council aim to achieve through operational efficiency
programs?
Part 2 Given the significant potential for cost savings and efficiency gains from generative AI
tools like ChatGPT, please explain what actions Council it is taking to assess or
implement these technologies in its operations
Response from the CEO
Part 1 Council’s annual budget process includes the achievement of a 0.5% efficiency saving
target for each Division’s budgeted expenditure as well as the identification of any
additional revenue streams to ensure that the annual net cost of services increase in
line with the annual rate cap.
Part 2 Council’s current use of AI for increased efficiency and availability of information for our
community is provided via BayBot AI Chatbot on our website, in conjunction with MyLot
to provide natural language, contextual building and planning information to residents.
Council is developing use cases to improve processes using AI including robotic
process automation and agentic AI.
