6. Public Question Time
1. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question related to accessibility at Half Moon Bay, and Mr Naylor
asked:
Question
a) Could Council please explain how mobility impaired pedestrians & carers safely move
from Beach Rd down the steep hill of Cerberus Way to Half Moon Bay and back
(without the use of a vehicle)?
b) Could Council please outline its traffic management plan for the Black Rock boat
ramp area to ensure the safety of pedestrians including mobility impaired, eg
wheelchair users with carers etc?
Response from the CEO
a) Pedestrian access from Beach Road to the Half Moon Bay B14 car park is via the
footpath along Cerberus Way. The area has uniquely steep and challenging natural
topography and due to erosive cliffs and the historic development of the area, access
could be restricted for some users with limited mobility.
A goal of the Red Bluff to Half Moon Bay Masterplan 2019 was to, where possible,
improve all ability access. During investigations for the masterplan it was determined
that access improvements could be best achieved by providing additional disabled
parking spaces in the B13 and B14 car parks. There are now six accessible spaces at
Half Moon Bay including three in the lower B14 car park. Council is upgrading public
toilet facilities at the Half Moon Bay Life Saving Club to include a Changing Places
facility.
b) A designated boat trailer waiting lane has been line marked through the B14 car park
to reduce congestion for through traffic when there are queues to use the boat ramp.
Council has also improved pedestrian and access pathways around the B14 car park.
