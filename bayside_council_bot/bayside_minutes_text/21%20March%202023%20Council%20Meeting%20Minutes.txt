6. Public Question Time
1. Ms Diarne Revelle
Ms Diarne Revelle submitted a question regarding Item 10.1 on the Agenda – Council’s role in
the national establishment of a First Nations Voice to Parliament, and Ms Revelle asked:
Question
Why would anyone vote yes and support an undecided policy to change the Constitution of
Australia, which Bayside council are interfering in and Involving in a Federal government
matter?
Response
In the lead up to the referendum, the position Council is considering relates to ensuring our
community is well-informed about the purpose, process and importance of the referendum to
make an informed decision. Council recognises everyone’s right to choose how to vote.
Council has already unanimously endorsed support of the Uluru Statement from the Heart on
17 August 2021, including the establishment of a First Nation’s Voice to Parliament
enshrined in the Constitution. This is also consistent with Council’s endorsed vision for the
Reconciliation Action Plan in 2022.
2. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
The Honourable Timothy Wilson submitted a number of questions regarding the hosting of
Council events. As Council’s Governance Rules permit only 2 questions per individual, only
the first 2 questions have been responded to. Mr Wilson’s first question is as follows:
Question
Bayside Council has advertised a "Home Energy Efficiency Expo" and is advertised to be in
partnership with the Federal Member for Goldstein. Can Council please advise what financial
contribution the Federal Member for Goldstein has made to the hosting or promotion of this
event?
Response
The Federal Member for Goldstein independently engaged service providers to provide the
equipment used at the Home Energy Efficiency Expo.
In addition, the Federal Member for Goldstein provided in-kind support in co-organising the
event, promotional activities, guest speakers and staff to assist in managing the event on the
day.

Bayside City Council Council Meeting - 21 March 2023
3. The Honourable Timothy Wilson
Mr Wilson’s second question is as follows:
Question
Can Council please advise whom agreed the event should be hosted in partnership with the
Federal Member for Goldstein?
Does Bayside Council have a policy of co-branding and sponsoring activities and events with
State and Federal Members of Parliament? If not, why not? If so, can it be provided? And if
not, will it develop one?
Response
As part of the launch of Council’s Love Bayside – Go for Zero campaign, Council was planning
to host an energy efficiency expo and the Federal Member for Goldstein, Zoe Daniels MP had
also planned to host a similarly themed event at a similar time.
Rather than having two events with the same content, the decision was made by Council
officers in consultation with the Office of the Federal Member for Goldstein to collaborate and
deliver the Home Energy Efficiency Expo in partnership for the benefit of Bayside residents.
The joint approach resulted in Council having access to greater promotion and exposure of the
event, as well as access to a broader network that included high profile guest speakers that
led to over 300 participants attending the Expo on the 18 March 2023 at the Brighton Town
Hall.
In relation to the question does Council have a policy, There is no policy for cobranding with
State and Federal Members of Parliament.

4. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question regarding infringement notices issued to owners of
unregistered dogs and Mr Howard asked:
Question
Part 1. How does Council store location data (i.e spreadsheet or database) in relation
infringement notices issued for unregistered dogs?
Part 2. How many infringements notices were issued for unregistered dogs in Elsternwick Park
South during 2022?
Response
Part 1 Response:
This information is recorded in Council’s infringement database and the location of offence is
referenced to the property the dog is homed at for all warning and infringement notices issued
for unregistered dogs.
Part 2 Response:
The number of unregistered dog infringements by reserve is not available, as the location
relates to the dog’s home address and not the place or reserve where the offence is detected.
5. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a further question. The question is regarding local law officer
patrols, and Mr Howard asked:
Question
Does Council have records of when local laws officers patrol Council parks or reserves (i.e
date, time and duration)?
Response
Council Officers record patrols of parks and reserves on their daily activity sheets. Council is
looking at ways of digitising this work to enable better reporting.

6. Mr Angus Howard
Mr Angus Howard submitted a question regarding Council’s carbon footprint, and Mr Howard
asked:
Question
Part 1. Does Council take into account all upstream and downstream emissions when
calculating the organisation's carbon footprint, including all services providers such as
contractors who provide waste services and maintenance of Councils open space, roads etc,
and travel undertaken by staff and Councillors?
Part 2. Is Council carbon neutral when all upstream and downstream emissions are taken into
account?
Response
In 2008, Bayside City Council committed to be ‘Carbon Neutral’ for its operations by 2020
through implementing a program of actions to avoid, reduce and offset greenhouse gas
emissions.
The Australian Government’s Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard (CACNS) for
organisations is a voluntary standard to manage greenhouse gas emissions and to achieve
carbon neutrality. This standard is used to assess Council’s greenhouse gas emissions status.
It provides best-practice guidance on how to measure, reduce, offset, validate and report
emissions that occur as a result of the operations of an organisation.
As part of the process of measuring, there are carbon accounting principles which need to be
considered when establishing the organisational boundary for greenhouse gas emissions.
These principles are based on those outlined in various International and Australian Standards.
Council has followed these principles in establishing our organisational boundary, and have
included our major contractors fuel, electricity and gas usage, as well as employee travel and
newly created Work from Home emissions sources. Council reports its emissions sources
through the Public Disclosure Statement found on the Climate Active website.
Based on Council’s approach to establishing our organisational boundary, Council has
achieved carbon neutral status as an organisation for three years in a row.
