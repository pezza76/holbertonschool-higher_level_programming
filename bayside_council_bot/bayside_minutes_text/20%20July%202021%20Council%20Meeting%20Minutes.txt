6. Public Question Time
In accordance with Chapter 2, Section 57 of Council’s Governance Rules, 20 public
questions were submitted to the Meeting. In accordance with the resolution at the June 2021
Ordinary Meeting of Council, temporary meeting procedures with regard to public question
time are in place:
• All questions received and responses are read out at the meeting within the allotted 15
minute timeframe for public question time.
• All questions and responses read out will be recorded in the minutes.
• A written response will be provided to all questions received.
1. Mrs Moira Deeming
Mrs Moira Deeming submitted a question regarding gender identity based/targeted services
and facilities, and Mrs Deeming asked:
Question
Under Victorian law, is it legal for Local Government Councils to provide sex based/targeted
services and facilities separately to gender identity based/targeted services and facilities? If
not, why not? For example, can we legally put signs on a set of public toilets declaring that one
is for biological males (including males with an intersex condition), one is for biological females
(including biological females with an intersex condition) and one is for people with transgender
identities (of any biological sex)? If not, why not?"
Response from the CEO
Both the Federal Sex Discrimination Act 1994 (as amended by the Sexual Orientation, Gender
Identity and Intersex Status Amendment Act 2013) and Victorian Equal Opportunity Act 2010
anti-discrimination legislation prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity or
intersex status.
Under these laws, it is discriminatory to require a person who is transgender to use a toilet
which does not align with their gender identity. Section 8 of the Victorian Charter of Human
Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 reiterates the right of all Victorians to equality and non-
discrimination, ensuring everyone has the same rights and benefits and the same level of
respect and dignity.
Access to public toilets supports social participation and inclusion for all, regardless of sex,
gender, gender identity or abilities. As a result, Council’s Public Toilet Strategy 2019 to 2023
states that the default option for all new toilets in the public realm will be all-gender toilets.

2. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds has submitted a question regarding the annual budget, and Mr Reynolds
asked:
Question
Council, at the Special Meeting held on 23rd June 2020, declared a that a General Rate of
$81,415,904 is to be collected.
(a) Where, in the comprehensive income statement shown in the annual budget, can the
ratepayer find the "estimated comprehensive expenditure", to be provided from the
General Rate, that is an essential part of the calculation of the General Rate: and
(b) Where, in the annual budget document, can the ratepayer find the sum of the materiality
allowance that has been added to the estimated comprehensive expenditure, to form the
"estimated amount to be raised by general rates" as required by the Regulations?
Response from the CEO
The annual budget has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Local
Government Act, Reporting Regulations, and Australian Accounting Standards, none of which
require the disclosure of the items raised in the question.
3. Mr George Reynolds
Mr George Reynolds submitted a second question. The question is in relation to regarding
Council’s Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021, and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
At the June 15th Council meeting, Council appears to have "made" a local law, called
Neigbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021, commencing on July 1st 2021. The Local Law is
claimed to be made using the authority of the Local Government Act 1989.
(a) Why has Council not published, in the Government Gazette, the public notice required
by s1119(c) of the enabling Act, instead of the notice amending the police authority under
the 2012 law; and
(b) Is Council enforcing the 2012 Law, with its expired enabling Act, or the 2021 law which
has not been correctly made?
Response from the CEO
(a) Council published a notice of the making of the “Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law
2021” in the Government Gazette on 24 June 2021, in accordance with the
requirements section 119(3) of the Local Government Act 1989.
(b) Council is enforcing the Neighbourhood Amenity Local Law 2021 which has been
correctly made pursuant to the relevant requirements and provisions of the Local
Government Act 1989 as required at the time of its making.

4. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a question regarding the Brighton Grammar School Proposal in
relation to Wilson Recreation Reserve, and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
RE: Brighton Grammar School Proposal & Wilson Recreation Reserve overflow usage &
communication to the community.
During the 16th Feb Council meeting there was a question from Cr Del Porto to Mr Van Trier
asking “how long has the school taken up the spillover option for the reserve” (for school
recess and lunchtime use). Mr van Trier’s response was "2 years" and is "now into its 3rd
year". However, on 5th July 2021, Cr Martin stated in an email to me that Brighton
Grammar's usage of the reserve had not changed for 20 years.
Response from the CEO
As per the response provided by Mr Van Trier at the 16 February 2021 Ordinary Meeting of
Council, Brighton Grammar School is now in its third year of utilising Wilson Recreation
Reserve for ‘spillover’ periods including recess and lunchtime.
5. Dr Zena Burgess
Dr Zena Burgess submitted a question regarding Council’s heritage study, and Dr Burgess
asked:
Question
Only some home owners who were part of the 2018 Bayside council heritage initiative have
received a letter of intent in relation to the current council heritage overlay listing. Does the
absence of a letter indicate that the home is being exempted from the study? Because home
owners are worried and frightened will council release publicly a list of all persons /properties
to whom letters have been sent.
Response from the CEO
The Mid-Century Modern Heritage Study is still being prepared and assessment of properties
is being undertaken. Council will be in contact with respective property owners once the draft
Study has been finalised.
Council has a contact list of people who have requested to be kept up to date of the Mid-
Century Modern Heritage Study and its progress. Any person on this list is informed of any
upcoming Council meetings where a report in relation to the Study is to be presented. This
contact list does not provide indication of property owners that have and have not been
exempted from the Study as Council is still finalising the study.
Page No. 9

Bayside City Council Ordinary Council Meeting - 20 July 2021
6. Dr Zena Burges
Dr Zena Burgess submitted a second question in relation to heritage matters, and Dr Burgess
asked:
Question
Re Heritage listing
a) Have home owners been advised of the implications and consequences of heritage
listing on their homes and any advantages (quantified and costed) and disadvantages
(quantified and costed).
b) Could council undertake to provide this detail to residents and the public?
Response from the CEO
The Mid-Century Modern Heritage Study is still being prepared and assessment of properties
is being undertaken. Council will be in contact with respective property owners once the draft
Study has been prepared.
As part of this consultation period, property owners will have the chance to discuss any
concerns or voice any questions they have in relation to the draft Study and the prepared
Statement of Significance for their property.
7. Mr Jeff Naylor
Mr Jeff Naylor submitted a second question. The question relates to Council’s Draft Municipal
Health and Wellbeing Plan, and Mr Naylor asked:
Question
RE: Item10.3 Draft Municipal Health and Wellbeing Plan 2021-2025
Council has proposed inserting a Disability Action Plan under their Municipal Health and
Wellbeing Plan. I have sought professional advice on this and discovered that no Council in
Victoria has successfully implemented a DAP using this model and that 'best practice' was for
the DAP to be either; a stand-alone document OR sit directly under the Council Plan.
The ALGA (Australian Local Government Association) produced Disability Inclusion Planning
– A Guide for Local Government which covers what needs to be in a DAP. As I understand it,
Council's current strategy won't meet the full requirements of this guide.
1. Why is Council proposing to implement a Disability Action Plan under the Municipal
Health & Wellbeing plan when this appears to not meet the ALGA guidelines & is not
current best practice?
2. Can Council please explain why it is so against a stand-alone Disability Action Plan?
Response from the CEO
1. The Municipal Public Health and Wellbeing Plan and its associated Action Plans are
based on best practice and meet the following requirements: Public Health and
Wellbeing Act 2008, Disability Act 2006 Victoria, and the Australian Local Government
Association guidelines 2016 (ALGA).
Page No. 10

Bayside City Council Ordinary Council Meeting - 20 July 2021
In particular, the ALGA guidelines emphasise the importance of involving people with a
disability in the planning and development of the Disability Action Plan, preferably
through the form of an Advisory Committee – in Council’s case, the Disability Access
and Inclusion Advisory Committee.
Bayside City Council has adhered to these national guidelines.
2. Council will have a stand-alone Disability Action Plan which will sit directly under the
Municipal Public Health and Wellbeing Plan. This has been discussed with Council’s
Disability Access and Inclusion Advisory Committee of which Mr Naylor is a member.
The proposed standalone Disability Action Plan will provide actions with a specific focus
on access and inclusion and removing barriers for people with a disability in Bayside.
Council’s proposed Disability Action Plan will meet the requirements of the Disability Act
2006.
8. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a question regarding school’s using Council’s online booking form
for sportsground use, and Mr Howard asked:
Question
Council’s online form “Apply to Use a Sportsground for School” enables schools to apply to
use a sportsground for the next school term only. There is no provision to book for multiple
terms. The agreement that schools acknowledge when making a booking states “The
organisation understands that the sportsgrounds are not to be used for any purpose other than
those detailed on the sportsground options summary and that using the sportsground for any
other purpose will void any agreement with Bayside City Council.”|
Question part 1. Under Council policy are schools allowed to book a sportsground from more
than one school term at a time?
Question part 2. Is it correct to assume that the sportsground booking agreement as
mentioned above, precludes schools from booking a sportsground for non-sports use?
Response from the CEO
1. Terms two and three bookings are made available to book at the same time. Terms
one and four have restricted date ranges as they include seasonal changeover
between sports where maintenance is required and are booked on a per term basis.
2. Sportsgrounds are made available for non-sporting activities with schools selecting
‘other purpose’ at the time of submitting their booking request.

Bayside City Council Ordinary Council Meeting - 20 July 2021
9. Mr Kevin Howard
Mr Kevin Howard submitted a second question. The question relates to Brighton Grammar
School’s use of Wilson Recreation Reserve, and Mr Howard asked:
Question
1. Does Brighton Grammar School use Council’s standard online sportsground booking
form, including the Agreement, when applying to use the sportsground on Wilson
Recreation Reserve?
2. Exactly what are the terms and details of Brighton Grammar School’s current booking
of the sportsground on Wilson Recreation Reserve, including days, times and duration
in school terms?
Response from the CEO
1. Brighton Grammar applies for use via the ‘Apply to Use a Sportsground for school’ form
and are subject to the terms and conditions of all other Schools utilising Bayside
Sportsgrounds.
2. During term 3 Brighton Grammar use the sportsground as follows:
Lunch time access 12:40 – 1:30pm
except Thursday 1:30 – 2:20pm
Monday to Thursday 3:30pm – 5:30pm
Saturday 8:00am – 2:00pm
The remaining 11 questions submitted (from: Mr Glenn Taylor, Mrs Fiona Marshall, Mr Matthew
Marshall, Mrs Melanie Jarman, Mrs Vanessa White, Mrs Mary Larsen, Mr Ian Larsen, Mr David

Bayside City Council Ordinary Council Meeting - 20 July 2021
11. Reports by Delegates
1. Association of Bayside Municipalities – Cr Fiona Stitfold reported that the Association
had not met since the previous Council meeting.
2. Metropolitan Transport Forum – Cr Castelli Sonia attended the recent Forum and
indicated that there were two main presentations at the meeting. One was from a PHD
candidate about research into cycling attitudes within metro Melbourne. The study found
that there are a larger number of residents that are 'interested but concerned' about
cycling and that some targeted support to that group could increase cycling numbers.
The other presentation was from Moreland City Council on a pilot they ran with East
Brunswick Primary School as part of their Moreland Street for Schools project. This trial
closed off sections of road to encourage more people to walk, ride and use active
transport to get to school. The project achieved a notable increase in active transport.

change, financial support for urban strategies and social housing, which were all carried.
