6. Public Question Time
1. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Council’s Auditing processes,
and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
(a) As, when the 2023-24 annual accounts were approved by Councillors, a staff report
showed immense enthusiasm that FLB Mann Judd were to be appointed as auditors,
when did the nominated entity decline the appointment, AND
(b) if the nomination was not declined, for what reason was the nomination of Mann Judd
altered to another auditor, without a modifying resolution being put to Council?
Response from the CEO
HLB Mann Judd are the contracted audit firm appointed by the Victorian Auditor General’s
Office to audit the Financial and Performance Statement of Bayside City Council. This
arrangement has been in place since 2021–22.
2. Mr George Reynolds submitted a question related to Council’s Income Statement,
and Mr Reynolds asked:
Question
a) As the Comprehensive Income Statement, defined by Local Government Victoria, is
not an income statement as defined by the Australian Accounting Standards, would
Council please advise the authority that Council staff have relied upon to substitute
an audit of the Comprehensive Income Statement for the audit of the consolidated
revenue statement (otherwise known as Adjusted Underlying Revenue} as required
by Schedule 3 of the Local Government (Planning ang Reporting) Regulations 2020
(b) Did the auditor employed to sign the audit certificate offer any assurance or
guarantee that their novel interpretation was sufficient to meet the requirements of the
Audit Act?
Response from the CEO
a) Schedule 3 of the Local Government Planning and Reporting Regulations specifies
the Performance indicators Council is required to report. These are all reported on in
Council’s Performance Statement, including the indicator for adjusted underlying
result. AASB101 Presentation of Financial Statements requires Council to present a
Comprehensive Income Statement as part of its audited financial statements.
b) Council’s auditors issued an unqualified audit opinion for the 2023–24 financial
statements.

3. Ms Alysia Regan submitted a question related to the Moorabbin Activity Centre
Program, and Ms Regan asked:
Question
a) In relation to the Moorabbin Activity Centre Program and the Built Form Overlay,
which other Council do we believe have been provided with applicable schedules and
why hasn’t applicable schedules been received by Bayside Council?
b) Is Kingston Council open to hosting the proposed MACP multi story apartments on
the Kingston side of Nepean Highway?
Response from the CEO
a) Information has not been provided to Council by the Victorian Planning Authority as to
which councils have been provided draft schedules to the Built Form Overlay, and
why Bayside Council was not included in the initial distribution.
b) The proposed Moorabbin Activity Centre Plan applies to Glen Eira, Kingston and
Bayside councils. Bayside City Council cannot speak to the views of the City of
Kingston regarding the Activity Centre Plan.
4. Ms Alysia Regan submitted a question related to Changing Places facilities and Ms
Regan asked:
Question
Has Bayside Council received or applied for further funding to support a third Changing
Places bathroom facility? If yes, has a location been determined?
Response from the CEO
Bayside Council has received funding for a third Changing Places bathroom to be located at
the Beaumaris Arts Group facility. Funding has also been received for a further Changing
Places facility, with the location yet to be determined pending finalisation of a feasibility study
for one at Rickett’s Point.

5. Mr Douglas Klein (on behalf of the Highett Progress Association) submitted a
question related to the public park in Eddie Street, Highett and Mr Klein asked:
Question
Part 1: What was the rationale for the complete removal of garden beds and undergrowth
last week, the timeline for replacement and whether this is compatible with
Council’s Urban Forest Strategy.
Part 2: Does the Council agree that such actions should have been publicly communicated
in advance to mitigate the alarm now expressed by Highett residents?
Response from the CEO
Part 1: Works were undertaken in the garden beds as part of Council’s perennial garden
bed renovation program. In late spring, the beds are prepared by removing old and
spent vegetation, with trees and shrubs in good condition retained. The next step
will be to spray out excessive weeds and mulch the bed. The timing of this enables
the mulch to break down over summer/autumn which allows organic matter,
microflora and microfauna to establish and re-build in the hydrophobic soils. The
beds will be re-mulched toward the end of summer, with the planting of indigenous
and native species to occur during the planting season – up to 3000 plants in
Pennydale and up to 8,000 in Tibrockney. This is a proven method and used widely
across the horticultural industry and is consistent with Council’s Urban Forest
Strategy.
Part 2: Bayside has been undertaking this practice for several years and it has not been
normal practice to communicate garden bed renovations in parks, and in previous
works this has not raised the same concern that has been experienced in this
instance. In future instances, Council will install signage to explain the works being
undertaken and provide greater information on the process.
